The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for\nJapan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside\ncompetition.\n    Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of\nattempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said \"I am not sure\nit is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of\nMrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a\npersonal interest in this problem.\n    \"I don't understand it to be closed at all.\"\n    Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be\n\"talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what\nthey do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very\nserious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not\nas free as we allow access to our markets to be.\"\n    He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain\ncould revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance\ninstitutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar\ntreatment in financial markets in Japan soon.\n    \"I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will,\"\nHoward added.\n    During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo\nStock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry,\nand Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa.\n    Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any\nsignificant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese\ntelecommunications industry.\n    Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined\nagain today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war.\nThis was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul\nChannon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war.\n    He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain\nbelieved a \"sensible solution\" could be found which would open\nJapanese markets to British goods.\n    Government officials were at pains today to deny that\nBritain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise\nsimilar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial\nfirms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms.\n    They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials\nhad said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial\ninstitutions could be imposed from then but that this did not\nnecessarily constitute a deadline.\n    Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against\nJapanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. But\ndespite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade\nelsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move to\nbackfire.\n    He said in a radio interview today  \"it is true that we\nbenefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose\nthose advantages. And I am sure they are making their views\nplain to the Japanese government on this matter.\"\n    Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea before\nreturning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo was\nplanned well before the current trade row.\n    Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also\ninclude ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global\nmarkets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a\ncooperation between national regulatory bodies.\n    He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging\ninformation to combat financial fraud would be sought with\nJapan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between\nBritain and the United States.\n REUTER", "authors": [{"first": "Sten", "last": "Stovall", "email": null}], "date": "1987-04-03T13:30:26", "geopoint": {"lat": 0.3845488, "lon": 9.458785}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 3 -", "normalized": "1987-04-03", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.484}, {"text": "next week's", "normalized": "1987-04-10", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.30200000000000005}, {"text": "tomorrow", "normalized": "1987-04-04", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.04200000000000004}, {"text": "today", "normalized": "1987-04-03", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "three weeks", "normalized": "1987-03-13", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "yesterday", "normalized": "1987-04-02", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "April 11", "normalized": "1987-04-11", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "LONDON", "key": "london", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "UK", "key": "uk", "confidence": 1.8, "country_code": "gb"}, {"name": "TOKYO", "key": "tokyo", "confidence": 1.8}, {"name": "Japan", "key": "japan", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "jp"}, {"name": "Britain", "key": "britain", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "U.K.", "key": "uk", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "gb"}, {"name": "Europe", "key": "europe", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "South Korea", "key": "southkorea", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "kr"}, {"name": "the United States", "key": "theunitedstates", "confidence": 0.0}], "topics": [], "places": ["uk", "japan"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "London, TOKYO"}, "countryKeys": ["gb", "jp", "kr"]}

Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with\nFebruary's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment\ndropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.\n    \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we\nend the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley\nand Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in\nthe second and third quarters.\"\n    \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\"\nhe said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but\nclearly they can't tighten.\"\n    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward\nrevision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000\nfrom 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter\nwere weaker than expected.\n    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.\ngross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March\njobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter\ngrowth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.\n    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average\nmonthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only\n237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.\n    \"There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, \nbut less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs\nwere subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed\ntightening for exchange-related purposes.\"\n    In March, the average workweek fell back to its January\nlevel of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing\nhours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9\nhours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.\n    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing\njobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and \nelectronic manufacturing.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a\n13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for\nnearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.\n    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories\nresulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with\nthe labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.\n    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five\npct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in\nthe first-quarter GNP accounts.\n    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two\npct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the\nsecond and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial\nactivity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate\ncontribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\"\n    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains\nin industrial production and personal income for March.\nThey expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for\nthese indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct\nin industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.\n    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop\nin March construction employment may also signal a drop in\nMarch housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851\nmillion units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in\nJanuary.\n    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level\nsince March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed\nout that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which \nfell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.\n    \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for\nwork, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said.\n    He said the latest employment report will not concern the\nFed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of\n2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten\nto quickly either.\"\n    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal\nfluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor\nforce gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them\nin January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with\nhis forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.\n    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think\nthat the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their\nmeeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to\nease,\" he said.

Lawrence said. \"Their (Fox) saving\ngrace is that their parent has deep pockets.\"\n    The question television industry, advertising and Wall\nStreet executives are asking is whether this new entry can lure\nadvertisers from the big three: CBS Inc <CBS>, ABC, and NBC, a\nunit of General Electric Co <GE>.\n    Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in\n1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier, with NBC accounting for\nall of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined, analysts\nnoted.\n    \"They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as the\ntraditional networks,\" said Jon Mandel, associate media\ndirector at Grey Advertising Inc.\n    But James Mandelbaum, a Los Angeles-based entertainment\nattorney said, \"If they have enough money, they have a good\nchance of making it work.\"\n    Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects to\nlose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mln\ndlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn a\nprofit.\n    To succeed, the company must also win over the young\nviewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows, two of\nwhich debut this Sunday, and another, next weekend.\n    The first Fox-produced program -- \"The Late Show,\"\nfeaturing comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall on\nFox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although the\nshow has dropped recently in ratings, it still has a captive\nyoung audience in the late night time slot, analysts said.\n    Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy,\n\"Married ... with Children,\" which Kellner describes as an\nalternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks.\nIt is also airing \"The Tracy Ullman Show,\" featuring the\nBritish comedienne, singer and actress.\n    Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around the\nU.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiated\nstations.\n    To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs, the\ncompany is taking the unprecedented step of airing them three\ntimes in the course of the evening.\n    \"I believe if some of their shows were on the traditional\nnetworks, it would be extremely high-rated,\" Mandel said, who\nadded that his firm has signed up several million dlrs in\nadvertising for the shows.\n    But some question whether Fox will really become a fourth\nnetwork.

{"id": "13157", "title": "FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY", "content": "The Federal Open Market Committee at\nits February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the\nthen-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.\n    The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy\ndirective which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than\neasier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January\nthrough March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no\nM-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a\nseven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.\n    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds\nrate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.\n    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members\ndiscussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in\nParis for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No\nconclusions were contained in the minutes.\n    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC\nsaid that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable\ndepending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into\naccount the strength of the business expansion, developments in\nforeign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and\nconditions in domestic and international credit markets.\"\n    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged\npolicy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president\nfavored some tightening of reserve conditions.\n    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November\nthrough January and the firm federal funds rate that had\nprevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He\nalso cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.\n    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential\nfor a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed\nthat prompt restraints might avert the need for more\nsubstantial tightening later.\n    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC\nminutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy\nimplementation should be especially alert to the potential need\nfor some firming of reserve conditions.\"\n    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in\nline with current expectations and there were concurrent\nindications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the\nbackground of stronger economic data.\n    One indication of potential price pressure might be a\nfurther tendency for the dollar to weaken.\n    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,\npreferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing\nduring the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not\nwant to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during\nthe inter-meeting period, although they did not view the\nconditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\"\n    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the\ndollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any\nsignificant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In\naddition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be\nmade in reducing the federal budget deficit.\n Reuter", "authors": [], "date": "1987-04-03T16:35:26", "geopoint": {"lat": 43.0006253, "lon": -75.3137775}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 3 -", "normalized": "1987-04-03", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.48}, {"text": "FEBRUARY", "normalized": "1987-02-01", "source": "title", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 2.5}, {"text": "February 10-11", "normalized": "1987-02-10", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 2.418}, {"text": "January", "normalized": "1987-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.846}, {"text": "March", "normalized": "1987-03-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.814}, {"text": "February", "normalized": "1987-02-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "February 23", "normalized": "1987-02-23", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "November", "normalized": "1987-11-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "NEW YORK", "key": "newyork", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "Paris", "key": "paris", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "key": "us", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}, {"name": "Melzer", "key": "melzer", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "usa", "key": "usa", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}], "topics": ["money-supply"], "places": ["usa"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "New York, Paris"}, "countryKeys": ["us"]}

This capped\nthe U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen\nyesterday.\n    Treasury bills advanced on the week.

{"id": "13244", "title": "EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS", "content": "European Community (EC)\nfinance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for\ngreater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System\n(EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.\n    \"There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary\nSystem, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister Mark\nEyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of\ninformal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.\n    The gathering was the first such discussion since the\nsecond major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in\nJanuary.\n    The system has come under severe strain as funds have\nflowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS\ncurrency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against\nweaker currencies in the system.\n    But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading\nwestern industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at\naround current levels was working and this would allow the EC\nto speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the\nEMS.\n    He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the\nneed for closer coordination among EMS member governments of\ninterest rate policies and of interest rate differentials\nbetween different countries.\n    They also agreed they needed better coordination of\nexchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both\nwhen they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their\nagreed margins.\n    But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of\ntechnical problems and ministers would discuss these further in\nLuxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's\nMonetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.\n    He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic\nconvergence betwen Community countries and it was important\nthat interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange\nrates and inflation rates.\n    The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the\npresidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not\nproduced any agreement to move radically forward in developing\nthe EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and\nmonetary integration.\n    \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal\nfunctioning of the system,\" Eyskens said.\n    Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS\nhas to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all\nmovements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go\nahead.\n    EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the\nmeeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final\nphase of capital market liberalisation in October that would\ninclude safeguard clauses for member countries for which the\nmove would create difficulties.\n    Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also\ndiscussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS parities\nby letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by\ntelephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.\n    However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister\nGerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.\n    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told\njournalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater\ncoordination of exchange market intervention was the question\nof which currencies should be used to intervene and held in\ncentral bank reserves.\n    He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would\nwork better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an\nissue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the\nBundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.\n    He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments\nreflected a general feeling among participants that the way the\nJanuary reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.\n   The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and\nWest Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in\nthe system that forced the parity overhaul.\n REUTER",

Under an international convention, the\ndraft must be submitted for final comments to the pertinent\nauthorities.\n    Asked on Thursday about Boeing's role in the crash, a\nMinistry spokesman declined comment.\n    On September 6, 1985, Boeing issued an official statement\nsaying that repairs it had undertaken on the doomed Japan Air\nLines plane in 1978 were faulty.\n    However, no official, direct connection was then made\nbetween the faulty repairs and the crash.\n    The Japanese investigation team says in its draft report\nthat it believes those faulty repairs were the cause of the\n1985 accident, the investigator said.\n    The Boeing statement after the crash said: \"Examination of\nthe wreckage, the flight data recorder readout, the cockpit\nvoice recorder, and interviews with the surviving off-duty\nflight attendant indicate that decompression occurred in flight\ndue to a rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead.\n    \"The Boeing examination of the bulkhead at the site of the\ncrash has revealed that a relatively small section of the\nbulkhead splice, approximately 17 per cent, was not correctly\nassembled during repairs which Boeing made after a 1978 landing\naccident,\" the statement said.\n    The repairs were required after a 1978 landing accident at\nOsaka airport, in western Japan, in which the plane's tail\nscraped the runway.\n    The Japanese report also mentions the government inspectors\nwho in 1978 signed a certificate of airworthiness approving the\nrepairs, he said.\n    Police had investigated four inspectors, including one man\nwho two weeks ago killed himself by drinking insecticide after\nfour days of police questioning.\n    \"None of the four had looked at Boeing's repair work,\" the\ninvestigator said.\n REUTER", "authors": [{"first": "Janet", "last": "Snyder", "email": null}], "date": "1987-04-05T05:03:59", "geopoint": {"lat": 35.6768601, "lon": 139.7638947}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 5 -", "normalized": "1987-04-05", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.4859999999999998}, {"text": "August 12", "normalized": "1987-08-12", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.968}, {"text": "Thursday", "normalized": "1987-04-02", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "September 6, 1985", "normalized": "1985-09-06", "source": "content", "has_year": true, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.5}, {"text": "two weeks ago", "normalized": "1987-03-22", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "four days", "normalized": "1987-04-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "TOKYO", "key": "tokyo", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "Japan", "key": "japan", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "jp"}, {"name": "Seattle", "key": "seattle", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Washington", "key": "washington", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Ministry", "key": "ministry", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "key": "us", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}, {"name": "Osaka", "key": "osaka", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "usa", "key": "usa", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}], "topics": [], "places": ["japan", "usa"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "Tokyo, Japan"}, "countryKeys": ["jp", "us"]}

But if average consumer prices are\nhigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be\nbelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said.\n    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices\nstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can\nbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some\nof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there\nmay be slightly less growth in transport fuels.\n    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at\n428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.\nThis is about the same level as at the begining of the year.\n    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the\nprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of\nthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.\n    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell\nby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the\nyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but\na decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.\n    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,\nparticulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,\nthere is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported\nstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.\n    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes\non April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986.

Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled\n28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.\n    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast\n3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the\nlargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA\nsaid.\n    Saudi Arabia\"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.\n REUTER", "authors": [], "date": "1987-04-05T19:01:21", "geopoint": {"lat": 63.812899, "lon": -138.6484861}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 5 -", "normalized": "1987-04-05", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.4859999999999998}, {"text": "this year", "normalized": "1987-04-05", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.29600000000000004}, {"text": "last year's", "normalized": "1986-04-05", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "April 1", "normalized": "1987-04-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "98 days", "normalized": "1987-12-28", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "the year", "normalized": "1987-04-05", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "January", "normalized": "1987-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "February", "normalized": "1987-02-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "March", "normalized": "1987-03-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "April 1 1986", "normalized": "1986-04-01", "source": "content", "has_year": true, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.5}, {"text": "year-on-year", "normalized": "1987-04-05", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "five\nyears", "normalized": "1987-04-05", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "January\n1", "normalized": "1987-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "April\n1", "normalized": "1987-04-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "January 1", "normalized": "1987-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "94 days", "normalized": "1987-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "PARIS", "key": "paris", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "key": "us", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}, {"name": "Canada", "key": "canada", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "ca"}, {"name": "Western Europe", "key": "westerneurope", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "france", "key": "france", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "fr"}], "topics": ["crude"], "places": ["france"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "Paris, Canada"}, "countryKeys": ["ca", "fr", "us"]}

But if average\nconsumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for\nthese fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.\n    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar\ncurrent levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.\n    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of\nthe market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.\n    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD\narea at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This\nis about the same as at the begining of the year.\n    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the\nprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of\nthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.\n    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes\non April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender\n1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to\n102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.\n    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is\ncontinuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line\nwith consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.\n    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put\nat 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one\nand equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.\n    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down\nfrom the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to\n94 days of consumption.\n    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company\nstocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first\nquarter of the year.

{"id": "13462", "title": "COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE", "content": "The International Cocoa Organization\n(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the\ndowntrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying\noperations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.\n    Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could\nreach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices\nsignificantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging\nthe market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the\nICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special\nDrawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level.\n    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last\nmonth by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer\nstock manager has completed preparations, traders said.\n    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer\nstock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used\nto calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average\nabove the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level.\n    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of\nthe second, third and fourth positions on the London and New\nYork futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per\ntonne yesterday.\n    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and\nSeptember, but these are set to change to July, September and\nDecember on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot\nmonth, traders noted.\n    The introduction of December into the calculations may lift\nthe daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75\nstg above May on the London terminal market.\n    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the\nhigher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the\nindicator which governs his activities, traders said.\n    \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the\nimplications of delaying until forward prices lift the\nindicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an\nanalyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.\n    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000\ntonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach\nthis level within six months, buying is suspended pending an\nICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market\nwatchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent\nforecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln\nto two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to\nthree mln.\n    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87\nworld surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared\nwith a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of\n94,000 tonnes, traders said.\n    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to\nbuy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the\n\"must buy\" level.\n    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put\nconstraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock\nmanager can remove cocoa from the market.\n    The buffer stock system of price differentials set\naccording to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from\nnon-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,\ndealers said.\n    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is\nnearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.\n    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as\nMalaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa\ncan only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer\nstock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.\n    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member\ncocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are\npressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.\n    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from\nquality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact\non futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for\nthis cocoa over futures.\n    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg\nfrom 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer\nstock buying, dealers said.\n    \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will\nprovide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said.\n    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer\nstock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to\npredict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically\nbuffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer\nstock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the\nprevious cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers\nexpressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.\n    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding\nscheme as an additional market support mechanism.\n REUTER", "authors": [{"first": "Jane", "last": "Merriman", "email": null}], "date": "1987-04-07T06:19:55", "geopoint": {"lat": 51.5001059, "lon": -0.1525063}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 7 -", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.484}, {"text": "10 day", "normalized": "1987-03-28", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.588}, {"text": "last\nmonth", "normalized": "1987-03-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "yesterday", "normalized": "1987-04-06", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "September", "normalized": "1987-09-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "July", "normalized": "1987-07-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "December", "normalized": "1987-12-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "April 15", "normalized": "1987-04-15", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "May", "normalized": "1987-05-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "six months", "normalized": "1987-10-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "one day", "normalized": "1987-04-06", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "a month ago", "normalized": "1987-03-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "June", "normalized": "1987-06-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "LONDON", "key": "london", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "New York", "key": "newyork", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Ivory Coast", "key": "ivorycoast", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Malaysia", "key": "malaysia", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "my"}, {"name": "Ghana", "key": "ghana", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "gh"}, {"name": "uk", "key": "uk", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "gb"}, {"name": "brazil", "key": "brazil", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "br"}], "topics": ["cocoa"], "places": ["uk", "malaysia", "brazil", "ghana"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "London, Malaysia"}, "countryKeys": ["br", "gb", "gh", "my"]}

Another poll forecast a\nConserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament.\n    But wariness of Bank of England sterling-selling\nintervention made participants cautious about pushing the pound\nmuch higher, dealers said.\n    Some dealers said the Bank of England was believed to have\nintervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they had\nnot detected such action. No polled dealer said he had sighted\nBank intervention today.\n    The dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 Swiss francs at\nmidsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90\nEuropean close.

{"id": "13629", "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - FOREIGN BANKS IN GERMANY", "content": "Foreign banks in West Germany are\nreassessing their positions after a number of changes in the\nmarkets and the regulatory environment that have dampened a\nonce-euphoric enthusiasm for expansion here.\n    Banking sources said the most important changes were plans\nto bring securities holdings into capital lending ratios, the\nfirst such move in a major financial centre. This could place a\nserious burden on several foreign banks, particularly those\nactive in primary and secondary bond markets. Foreign banks had\nmuch lower equity and reserve capital than most domestic banks.\n    Senior banking sources said talks between the Bundesbank\nand the banking supervisory office over bringing securities --\nprimarily bonds -- under banking laws governing capital ratios\nwere in progress.\n    Although no date had been set for imposition, banks as\nearly as this year may be obliged to bring bonds under 1985\nrules that limit bank lending to 18 times shareholders equity\nand reserves.\n    Although other national regulatory authorities are known to\nbe considering similar steps in light of growing securitisation\nof debt previously in the balance sheet, Germany, with its\ntradition of prudence, may be the first.\n    Brian Kissack, president of the Foreign Banks Association,\ntold Reuters, \"It's not a positive sign. It could cause certain\npeople who are not in (West Germany) to query whether it was as\nattractive to get in now.\"\n    Larger banks may begin to use global networks to pass on\nholdings in mark securities to other centres which had less\nstringent ratios, taking business out of the country, he added.\n    But sources said foreign banks faced a host of other\npractical problems as well. These included,\n    -- the apparent unwillingness of the Bonn government to\nmake an early move to abolish the stock exchange turnover tax.\n    -- signs that London's \"Big Bang\" may have deeper\nimplications for German securities trading than first thought.\n    -- difficulty in finding experienced securities\nprofessionals to staff new subsidiaries.\n    -- growing pressure on commercial banking margins that is\nforcing widespread retrenchment and refocusing of activities.\n    -- the threat of having to face a renewed push for market\nshare by the largest and most powerful Japanese banks.\n    By leaving the stock exchange turnover tax out of the\ninitial negotiating session of the incoming federal coalition\ngovernment, Bonn had dashed hopes it would soon be abolished.\n    The tax is 0.25 pct on each side of a securities trade by a\nnon-bank, but it is not levied on public authority bonds.\n    This extra cost, particularly for finely-priced instruments\nsuch as floating rate notes, had kept much mark securities\nbusiness firmly in the City, awaiting a change. But aside from\nthis, London was more active than domestic houses had expected.\n    Large U.S., British, Japanese and Swiss investors often\npreferred to execute block trades -- 50,000 shares and up --\nwith City market makers who could absorb at least some of the\npaper in their own positions, diminishing the immediate impact\non the share price.\n    Most German brokers and banks pass trades direct to the\nexchange floor, cutting profits or adding to costs.\n    Bank in Liechstenstein (Frankfurt) GmbH board member\nMichael Zapf said London's share of German securities business\ndone was causing foreign banks without German units to weigh\nwhether establishment costs involved were worth the returns.\n    Additional signs that London market makers may move into\nsecondary level stocks had added to this concern, he said.\n    Now, plans by many foreign banks to transfer mark\nsecurities trading entirely to newly established, mainly\nFrankfurt-based units were being reassessed, sources said.\n    The continuing existence of the stock exchange tax had also\neffectively prevented the birth of a short-term mark paper\nmarket in certificates of deposit or commercial paper.\n    Many U.S. Investment and money centre banks in particular\nwere hoping experience in these would provide the lever to\nprise open tight credit relationships between companies and\ntheir domestic \"house\" banks.\n    At the moment, U.S. Investment banks are expanding fastest\nhere. A unit of Salomon Inc <SB.N> began last summer and Morgan\nStanley Group Inc <MS.N> is currently fitting out offices,\nprobably for a summer start to business.\n    A unit of <Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co> should begin\noperations toward year end. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER.N>\nand Shearson Lehman Brothers are known to be weighing\nconversion of current, small operations to full-standing units.\n    But expansion had been hampered by the lack of experienced\npersonnel in a hitherto fairly small market. The big three\nSwiss banks, which arrived between late 1985 and first half\n1986, have been steadily building up securities departments,\ntaking staff equally from domestic and foreign competitors.\n    The two U.S. Banks longest established here, Citibank AG\nand Chase Bank AG, had been particularly hard hit.\n    Both banks recently announced plans to cut back commercial\nactivities and shut down German branch offices on orders from\nhead office. In the competitive environment, return on assets\nemployed was insufficient to meet requirements, sources said.\n    But the weakening attraction of \"Financial Centre Germany\"\nwas unlikely to deter major Japanese banks from setting up full\nsubsidiaries when the Bundesbank gives the green light for mark\neurobond lead management probably around third quarter 1987.\n    Once banks such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd <DIKB.T> and\nSumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> move in, competition for business,\nfor staff and even for premises would soar, sources said.\n REUTER", "authors": [{"first": "Allan", "last": "Saunderson", "email": null}], "date": "1987-04-07T08:25:50", "geopoint": {"lat": 50.1106444, "lon": 8.6820917}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 6 -", "normalized": "1987-04-06", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.4779999999999998}, {"text": "this year", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}], "georeferences": [{"name": "FRANKFURT", "key": "frankfurt", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "GERMANY", "key": "germany", "confidence": 1.8, "country_code": "de"}, {"name": "West Germany", "key": "westgermany", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Bonn", "key": "bonn", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "London", "key": "london", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "key": "us", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}, {"name": "Liechstenstein", "key": "liechstenstein", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "usa", "key": "usa", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}, {"name": "uk", "key": "uk", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "gb"}, {"name": "japan", "key": "japan", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "jp"}], "topics": [], "places": ["west-germany", "usa", "uk", "japan"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "Frankfurt, GERMANY"}, "countryKeys": ["de", "gb", "jp", "us"]}

to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed\ntheir economic growth.\n    Baker is also expected to outline proposals for making\nagreements to coordinate economic policies more binding.\n    The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks of\nthe Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italy\nand Canada to form the Group of Seven.\n    The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers of\nthe United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.\n    The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese Finance\nMinister Kiichi Miyazawa, West German Finance Minister Gerhard\nStoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson.\n    Baker and other finance ministers say they intend to\nreaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economic\ngrowth, reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies.\n    Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect is\nexpected after the meeting ends.\n    These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetings\nof the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n    At the same time, monetary sources say they expect Baker to\nput forward proposals, originally outlined at the 1986 Tokyo\nSummit, to tighten procedures for policy coordination.\n    Washington wants other major nations to establish specific\npolicy goals for economic growth, inflation, current account\nbalance of payments, trade balances, budget performance,\nmonetary conditions and currencies.\n    If actual economic performance veers sharply away from such\nobjectives, then countries should consult on whether corrective\naction is necessary, the proposal says.\n    Monetary sources said there was some support for the\nproposal, which may not be made final until the Venice Economic\nSummit in June, but Britain and West Germany were firmly\nagainst any attempt to make corrective action automatic.\n    The U.S. Treasury team, led by Baker, has worked on this\nplan since last September, when it won the support of France.\n    Baker, meanwhile, will press Japan and West Germany to live\nup to their commitments, made over six weeks ago in Paris, to\nboost their domestic demand to absorb more imports.\n    He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that the\nReagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on a\nsignificant budget deficit cut this year, helping to depress\nU.S. demand for imports.\n    The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the huge\nimbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on the\none hand, and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other.\n    Japan, in particular, is under pressure to come up with a\nmeaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen.\n    Financial markets appear to believe the yen should go\nhigher against the dollar, a development that has become\nunacceptable in Japan.\n    The Paris Agreement, by the United States, Japan, West\nGermany, France, Britain and Canada, called for currencies to\nbe stabilized around current levels.\n    But the dollar fell again just several weeks after the\nagreement was reached, and its present stability is said to be\ntemporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks.\n    Meanwhile, representatives of the leading Third World\ncountries continue preparing their position for their ministers\nto present to industrial nations later this week.\n    Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developing\nnations are preparing a very tough communique which brands the\nwestern strategy for shoring up the debt

For\nEast Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000\ntonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75\nmln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.\n    It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both\ncountries, but the effects of this will not be felt until\n1988-90.\n    Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees\nreacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male\ninflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.\n    Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected\nthis year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could\nespecially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,\nwhile in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and\nJuly/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.\n    Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's\nyields and bigger effects are expected within the next three\nyears, Oil World said without elaborating.\n    Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year\nwere put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in\nJanuary 1986, Oil World said.\n    West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop\n500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East\nMalaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.\n    Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about\neight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall\nIndonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct\nto 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,\nare put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.\n    Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are\nboth running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the\ncountry's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during\nJan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of\nthe April elections and the religious Ramadan festival\nthroughout May, it said.\n    Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to\n350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent\nIndonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the\ncountry but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill\nIndonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.\n REUTER", "authors": [], "date": "1987-04-07T09:32:30", "geopoint": {"lat": -6.2462233, "lon": 106.6215638}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 7 -", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.482}, {"text": "this year", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.358}, {"text": "Sept 1987", "normalized": "1987-09-01", "source": "content", "has_year": true, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 4.08}, {"text": "Jan/Sept 1986", "normalized": "1986-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": true, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.628}, {"text": "year", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "January 1986", "normalized": "1986-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": true, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.5}, {"text": "Jan/Sept", "normalized": "1987-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "June", "normalized": "1987-06-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "April 1", "normalized": "1987-04-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "a year ago", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "April", "normalized": "1987-04-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "May", "normalized": "1987-05-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "HAMBURG", "key": "hamburg", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "East Malaysia", "key": "eastmalaysia", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "West Malaysia", "key": "westmalaysia", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Indonesia", "key": "indonesia", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "id"}, {"name": "East", "key": "east", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Malaysia", "key": "malaysia", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "my"}, {"name": "west-germany", "key": "westgermany", "confidence": 0.0}], "topics": ["veg-oil", "palm-oil"], "places": ["west-germany", "malaysia", "indonesia"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "Hamburg, Indonesia"}, "countryKeys": ["id", "my"]}

The\ndeficit of 450 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 was\nonly slightly below the 515 mln dlr deficit for all of 1986.\n    The government has tightened up money supply, called for\nmaximum 5.0 pct wage increases -- the same as this year's\ninflation target -- and is pursuing a program of industrial\nrestructuring despite an unemployment rate of 21.5 pct.\n    Bankers say tight-money policies have attracted an\navalanche of foreign capital that is cashing in on the strong\npeseta and high interest rates and those funds, converted into\npesetas, are swelling money supply still further.\n    Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said last week that\nmoney supply is expected to rise 14.3 pct in the first quarter\ncompared with this year's eight pct target.\n    Most analysts agree that the government will have to accept\ninflation closer to six pct this year but they say there is\nlittle cause for alarm.\n    \"The money supply should be back on track by the summer and\nwe will begin to see lower interest rates,\" said Andres\nTrujillo, general manager of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking\nCorp's Madrid branch.\n    He told Reuters the labour protests, despite occasional\noutbursts of violence, are not having a serious impact on\nforeign investment.\n    \"Spain is a big and relatively underdeveloped market,\" he\nsaid. \"It is still easier to compete from here than in other\ncountries and this sporadic unrest is not likely to scare off\ninvestors.\"\n    Juan Jose Macaya, general manager of Investban SA, a\nportfolio management company, said he expects monetary\nobjectives to be under control in two or three months.\n    \"There has been some nervousness in the stock exchange but\nwe see this as a short-term reaction,\" he said.\n REUTER", "authors": [{"first": "Jules", "last": "Stewart", "email": null}], "date": "1987-04-07T09:38:31", "geopoint": {"lat": 40.416782, "lon": -3.703507}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 7 -", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.484}, {"text": "May 1", "normalized": "1987-05-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "last year", "normalized": "1986-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "year", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "last week", "normalized": "1987-03-31", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "this year", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}], "georeferences": [{"name": "MADRID", "key": "madrid", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "SPAIN", "key": "spain", "confidence": 1.8, "country_code": "es"}, {"name": "U.S.", "key": "us", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}, {"name": "Europe", "key": "europe", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Hong Kong", "key": "hongkong", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "hk"}], "topics": [], "places": ["spain"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "Madrid, SPAIN"}, "countryKeys": ["es", "hk", "us"]}

{"id": "13809", "title": "COLOMBIA ARRANGING TWO CO-FINANCINGS FOR PROJECTS", "content": "Colombia is in the process of arranging\ntwo co-financings for projects in the electrical sector,\ndirector of public credit Mauricio Cabrera said.\n    He told journalists he expects an 86.6 mln dlr loan to be\nco-financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to be\ncompleted by the middle of next month.\n    He also said talks have just concluded with the World Bank\non a 200 mln dlr co-financing and that discussions with the\nbankers will begin later this month.\n    Cabrera was here for the signing yesterday of a 50 mln dlr\nfloating rate note.\n    The floating rate note was the first such issue for\nColombia, which has had limited access to the international\ncapital markets since the eruption of the international debt\ncrisis in 1982, despite its ability to avoid a rescheduling.\n    The IADB co-financing is for Interconexion Electrica SA\n(ISA), a public electricity utility. The loan is for 10 years,\nwith four years grace. Interest will be at 1-1/8 pct during the\ngrace period after which the margin will rise to 1-1/4 pct,\nCabrera said. There is also a front end fee of one pct.\n    The cost of the project totals 301.6 mln dlrs, of which ISA\nwill contribute about 100 mln and the IADB 115 mln, he added.\n    Fuji Bank Ltd and Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd are arranging\nthe commercial bank portion of the financing. Cabrera noted\nthat only about 20 pct of the loan will be drawn this year.\n    He said the World Bank co-financing is likely to come to\nthe market no earlier than June. It is part of an overall\nfinancing for various projects in the electrical sector that\nwill take four years and cost about 300 mln dlrs a year.\n    Of the total cost, he expects the World Bank and the IADB\nto contribute about 700 mln dlrs, with the Export-Import Bank\nof Japan lending between 200 and 300 mln. The balance will come\nfrom commercial banks.\n    Cabrera said that Colombia also plans one other issue in\nthe international capital markets this year.\n    The country expected to launch up to 120 mln dlrs in\nfloating rate notes, but the market has virtually disappeared\nin the past few months as supply outstripped demand and the\nnumber of market makers contracted sharply.\n    Cabrera said he is now considering several options,\nincluding a fixed rate Eurobond and an issue in Japan.

The Bundesbank could now\nassume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency\ninflows slow down.\n    Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and\nlong term interest rate differentials, also encouraged\ninvestors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller\nsaid.\n    The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary\ngrowth back onto the desired path, he said.\n    \"Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this\nquiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the\nchanged economic situation of the last few months,\" he added.\n    \"All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money\nsupply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite\nsuppositions to the contrary,\" Mueller said.\n    \"Keeping money supply developments in check is not always\nsynonymous with raising interest rates, especially when\nexcessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than\ngrowth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary\nholdings of non-banks,\" Mueller said.\n    Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits\nother concepts were needed for monetary policy.\n    Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for\nmonetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.\n    In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.\nCurrency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.\n    But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of\na strict stability policy because both interest rates and\nliquidity would be affected by required currency intervention\nand could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.\n    Even interest rates are not in the centre of the\nBundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other\nmarket conditions, Mueller said.\n    A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central\nbank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.\n    This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity\nof industry and households which cannot be directly reached\nwith the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.\n    The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the\nharder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been\nthe case recently, because non-banks have received considerable\nsums from current account surpluses and capital imports.\n    \"If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise\nwith higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if\ncredit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed\nits target but probably even set off further inflows,\" he said.\n    Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.\n    In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate\nof seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.\n    The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to\nsix pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock\ngrowth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.\n    But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there\nshould be no change in priorities. \"Monetary policy must be\nfirst and foremost stability policy and successful stability\npolicy is money supply policy -- nothing else,\" he said.\n REUTER", "authors": [], "date": "1987-04-07T10:41:17", "geopoint": {"lat": 49.6806061, "lon": 10.5267235}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 7 -", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.4779999999999998}, {"text": "January", "normalized": "1987-01-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "FRANKFURT", "key": "frankfurt", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "Bavaria", "key": "bavaria", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "West Germany", "key": "westgermany", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "key": "us", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "us"}], "topics": ["money-supply", "money-fx"], "places": ["west-germany"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "Frankfurt, Bavaria"}, "countryKeys": ["us"]}

Rolls was\nrescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.\n    When the government announced the sale, it said it would\ninject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250\nmln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.\n    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit\nrating to match those of its main competitors such as General\nElectric Co <GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's <UTX.N> Pratt\nand Whitney unit.\n Reuter", "authors": [{"first": "Iain", "last": "Pears", "email": null}], "date": "1987-04-07T10:47:21", "geopoint": {"lat": 51.5074456, "lon": -0.1277653}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 7 -", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.484}, {"text": "tomorrow", "normalized": "1987-04-08", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.32999999999999996}, {"text": "this year", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.21999999999999997}, {"text": "Last month", "normalized": "1987-03-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}], "georeferences": [{"name": "LONDON", "key": "london", "confidence": 2.0}, {"name": "uk", "key": "uk", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "gb"}], "topics": ["earn"], "places": ["uk"], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "London"}, "countryKeys": ["gb"]}

{"id": "13995", "title": "LONDON MONEY MARKET CLOSES LITTLE CHANGED", "content": "Money market interest rates closed little\nchanged after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K.\nBase lending rates fizzled out, dealers said.\n    Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party\nwell ahead had little effect on the market with operators\nlooking for more definite news on the political front. Sterling\ncontinued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks in\nWashington this week.\n    One senior money broker commented, \"What we want is an\nelection date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once the\nmarket knows what's happening then we can move forward.\"\n    The next move in U.K. Base rates, which now stand at 10\npct, is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the date\nof a general election is making for cautious trading, dealers\nsaid.\n    Yesterday, opinion polls showing the Government was set to\nretain a substantial working majority lifted sterling and\nfuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates.\n    The British authorities are likely to remain cautious,\nhowever, as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to review\ntheir February Paris accord on currency stability. This could\naffect sterling which today was just one basis point lower in\ntrade weighted terms to stand at 72.3.\n    Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated the\nday-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank of\nEngland. As rates fell yesterday, no band four bills, which\nhave a maturity of between two and three months were\ntransacted. Today, however, these again appeared but the\nmajority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one to\ntwo months range.\n    The key one and three months interbank rates were unchanged\nquoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Until\nfresh economic or political news emerges, dealers say they\nexpect the market to continue around these levels with only\ntechnical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates.\n    The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in the\nsystem today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despite\nthis, overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct range\nhaving started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct.\n    Period interbank rates were little changed with six months\nquoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct.\n    Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and nine\nmonths ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pct\nrespectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change from\nlate yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and three\nmonths at 9-17/32 15/32 pct.\n REUTER", "authors": [], "date": "1987-04-07T11:00:48", "geopoint": {"lat": 13.1026983, "lon": 123.6987233}, "temporalExpressions": [{"text": "April 7 -", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "dateline", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 3.484}, {"text": "yesterday", "normalized": "1987-04-06", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.35}, {"text": "this week", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "February", "normalized": "1987-02-01", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "today", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": true, "confidence": 0.0}, {"text": "two months", "normalized": "1987-02-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "three months", "normalized": "1987-01-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "six months", "normalized": "1987-10-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "one year", "normalized": "1987-04-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "one month", "normalized": "1987-03-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}, {"text": "three\nmonths", "normalized": "1987-01-07", "source": "content", "has_year": false, "is_relative": false, "confidence": 1.5}], "georeferences": [{"name": "LONDON", "key": "london", "confidence": 3.8}, {"name": "U.K.", "key": "uk", "confidence": 0.0, "country_code": "gb"}, {"name": "Washington", "key": "washington", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "U.K. Base", "key": "ukbase", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "Paris", "key": "paris", "confidence": 0.0}, {"name": "England", "key": "england", "confidence": 0.0}], "topics": [], "places": [], "approximations": {"date_is_approx": false, "geopoint_is_approx": true, "geopoint_from": "London, Washington"}, "countryKeys": ["gb"]}
