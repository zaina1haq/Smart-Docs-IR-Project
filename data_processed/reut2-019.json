Eastman Kodak Co <EK>\nand W.R. Grace <WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but\nneither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.\n    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic\nproducts and with Grace to develop agricultural products.\n    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement \nan agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop\nnew biotechnology products in several fields.\n   \n    As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'\nanticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.\nSquibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but\nnot in North American and Western Europe.\n    \"We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood\nthat Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in\nNorth America and Europe,\" said Fildes.\n    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a\nmajor joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its\nown in that market.\n   \n    Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with\npharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own\nbusiness. Many large corporations have invested in small\nbiotech firms.\n    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made\nin biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus\nbecause it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship\nwith a large number of other biotechnology companies.\"\n   \n    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug\nareas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep the\nbiggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\"\n    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to\nbroaden the company's reach in such big money making areas\nas the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory\nmarkets.\n    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research\nover the next five years.\n   \n    \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and\ndevelopment to make it happen, while the equity position part\nof the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this\npartnership,\" said Fildes.\n Reuter",

It is a\nhidden, arbitrary and capricious tax,\" Wilson told the House of\nCommons.\n    The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian\neconomy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than\nimported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that\nmakes them less competitive, Wilson said.\n     Interim changes effective January 1, 1988 will include:\n     -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies\nrelated to manufacturers\n     -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the\nmanufacturer for a selected range of products\n     -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication\nservices, except for residential telephone lines\n     -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes.\n     To offset these changes for low income Canadians,\nrefundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50\ndlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children, the\nfinance department said.\n     Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new\nsales tax, including a goods and services tax, a value added\ntax and a national sales tax that would combine existing\nfederal and provincial levies into one system, Wilson told the\nHouse of Commons.\n     He said the federal government will explore the\npossibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10\nprovincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy a\nprovincial sales of tax of varying amounts.\n     Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for\ntaxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform.\n     If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national\nsales tax system, Wilson said the federal government will\nconsider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax.\n     A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to\nvirtually all goods and services in Canada and would include\nfurther increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle\nincome Canadians, the finance department said in documents\naccompanying Wilson's speech.\n     A federal value-added tax, similar to European tax\nsystems, would also be broad based but would allow more\nflexibility to exempt selected goods and services, the\ndepartment said. The finance deparment said the main drawback\nof a value added tax is that it would be more complex and\ncostly to implement than the other two proposals.\n Reuter",

    "content": "Finance Minister Michael Wilson tabled a\nways and means motion to immediately impose a special tax on\npreferred share dividends to eliminate a significant loss of\ncorporate tax revenue.\n    Under the motion, which is used to introduce most financial\ntax changes, dividends on all preferred shares issued after\nJune 18 will be taxable.\n    The issuing corporation will be able to choose between two\nforms of tax, one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with a\nsubsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder, and\none that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends.\n    \"Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-tax\nfinancing arrangements using preferred shares are a critical\nstep in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required to\nfund personal income tax reductions,\" Wilson explained.\n    The minister said many profitable corporations, using\nvarious deductions built up over the years, pay no taxes,\nalthough they are in a position to pay dividends out of their\nprofits.\n Reuter",

    "content": "Finance Minister Michael Wilson unveiled\na wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includes\nlimiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in the\ndividend tax credit.\n    With most changes effective at the first of next year,\nWilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax brackets\nfrom 10 to three.\n    He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by two\nbillion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over the\nnext five years.\n    \"Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of two\nfar-reaching changes. A new structure of federal income tax\nrates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to tax\ncredits,\" Wilson told the House of Commons.\n    The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27,500\ndlrs of taxable income, 26 pct on the next 27,500 dlrs and 29\npct on taxable income in excess of 55,000 dlrs. The maximum tax\nrate is 34 pct under the current system.\n    In a major reversal of his own initiative, Wilson said the\ncontroversial 500,000 dlrs capital gains exemption will be\nreduced to 100,000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime.\n    Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking office\nin 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment, but it was\nsharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous to\nwealthy investors.\n    The 500,000 dlr lifetime exemption  will be kept on the\nsale of farm land and for small businesess, however.\n    Also, the taxable portion of a capital gain will increase\nfrom 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990.\n    The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to\n25 pct and the deduction for up to 1,000 dlrs of interest and\ndividend income will be eliminated in 1988.\n    Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savings\nplan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of the\nincrease in the maximum limit to 15,500 dlrs will be delayed \nfour years to 1994.\n Reuter",

    "title": "FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY",
    "content": "New U.S. Banking data suggest the\nFederal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path\nand is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists\nsaid.\n    But they also said that if money supply growth remains\nweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline\nsuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its\ncredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary\npolicy.\n    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a\nforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June\n8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a\ndecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs\nto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for\nthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has\nfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,\neconomists said.\n    \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan\nof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of\neconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned\nthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth\nin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen\nas better gauges of economic growth.\n    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both\nmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's\n5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.\n    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,\nconcerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,\ncould turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.\n    \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open\nmarket position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end\nof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\"\n    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings\nof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period\nwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had\ntargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.\n    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day\nnet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher\nborrowings target would probably have been reached.\n    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in\nauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,\nwhile a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has\nhelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.\n    \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed\neasing at some point,\" he said.\n    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little\nattention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of\nyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the\neconomy,\" one said. \"I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is\nfalling apart and the Fed should ease.\"\n    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a\nprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary\npolicy.\n    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates\nfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and\nhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke\noff econmomic growth.\n    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late\nApril. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a\nfundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives\nthem more room to ease,\" he said.\n REUTER",

    "title": "AUSTRALIA'S OPPOSITION FACES SETBACK ON TAX PLAN",
    "content": "The conservative opposition, already\nfighting an uphill election battle, now faces controversy in\nits own ranks over a possible error in its major tax cutting\nprogram, economists said.\n    Professor Michael Porter, architect of the tax plan,\ndeclined to refute Treasurer Paul Keating's charge that the\nopposition miscalculated tax and expenditure cuts by several\nbillion dollars. Economists said the opposition, trailing\nbehind Labour in opinion polls, would find its chances further\ndiminished if its tax policy was a miscalculation.\n    The tax plan, unveiled by opposition leader John Howard\nlast week, is the cornerstone of the Liberal Party's economic\nstrategy to oust the Labour Party in the July 11 poll.\n    Keating has said the Howard tax plan would sharply increase\nthe budget deficit to more than nine billion dlrs and severely\ndamage Australia's economy, already overburdened with balance\nof payments and foreign debt problems.\n    In his mini-budget on May 13, Keating said the budget\ndeficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and\nthree billion dlrs.\n    Porter, a key member of the opposition economic think tank,\nsaid he played a leading role in formulating the tax plan but\nnot Howard's proposed expenditure savings, which Keating\nclaimed were distorted through double counting.\n    Some opposition members said there appeared to be errors,\nbut a Liberal Party spokesman refused comment, saying the\npackage was being reexamined.\n    \"The whole thing is so deceitful,\" Prime Minister Bob Hawke\nsaid in a radio interview. \"Howard has made a mess of it. If\nthey can't govern themselves, how can they expect to govern the\ncountry?\"\n    Hawke, who is seeking a third term, said the opposition had\nmade the election one of the easiest for him.\n    \"I've never felt more physically and mentally relaxed\n(during an election). We've no problems at all,\" he said.\n    The latest public opinion poll, published in the Melbourne\nSun newspaper, showed Labour was leading the opposition by 12\npoints, indicating a 66-seat majority for Hawke in parliament.\n    The Election Commission announced last night that 613\ncandidates would contest the 148-seat House of Representatives,\nwhile 255 candidates would fight for the 76 Senate seats.\n REUTER",

Aluminium is sold in\ndollars.\n    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to\nabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if\nprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.\n    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a\nyear, would probably lose money again in 1987.

    "content": "Investors on Philippine stock markets\nhave shrugged off growing communist activity in the cities to\npush share prices to all-time highs on record turnover, brokers\nsaid.\n    Regularly heavy trading of more than one billion shares a\nday has sent the Manila exchange's composite index soaring to\n775.9 from 577.2 points in just over three weeks.\n    Brokers described recent trading as \"frantic\" and \"hectic\" as\ntrading records were smashed day after day.\n    A total 2.6 billion shares worth 259.4 million pesos\nchanged hands on the main Manila and the less important Makati\nexchanges yesterday, with much of the activity among centavo\npriced stocks, brokers said. The turnover was more than double\nthe record of 1.1 billion shares worth 118.1 million pesos set\non Wednesday.\n    Brokers said rising gold prices caused mining shares to\nshoot up three weeks ago, and other sectors followed. Share\nprices continued their rise even when the gold price fell back\nto 450 dlrs an ounce, due to rising confidence in President\nCorazon Aquino's handling of the economy, they said.\n    Brokers said Aquino's handling of the 18-year-old communist\ninsurgency and the maintenance of relatively low interest rates\nalso contributed to the rise.\n    Blue chip stocks, such as those of San Miguel Corp and\nPhilippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT), have risen 25 pct\nin three weeks, and the trend is upward in the medium term\nalthough a temporary correction is overdue, they said.\n    Since the surge began on May 26, Manila's Mining index has\nrisen to 5,700.4 points from 4,042.4, its commercial and\nindustrial index has shot up to 881.0 from 694.9 points, and\nthe oils indicator has increased to 4.1 from 2.9 points.\n    Market activity has been rising in spurts since Ferdinand\nMarcos was replaced by Aquino 16 months ago.\n    One broker said he thought the Philippine stock market \"may\nat last have come of age.\"\n    Wilson Sy, president of Prudential Securities, a local\nstockbroking firm with Hong Kong affiliations, told Reuters,\n\"Barring any unforeseen political events you can bet on the\nPhilippine market. It has shrugged off the communist inroads\ninto Manila.\"\n    Assassins have killed 52 policemen, soldiers and security\nguards in the capital this year.\n    Communist hitmen known as sparrows have claimed they killed\n22 of them.\n    Sy said Philippine stocks were undervalued in world terms\nwith price-earnings ratios often half those in Hong Kong and\none-sixth those in Japan. He said PLDT, which is also U.S.\nListed, has a price-earnings ratio of about nine.\n    Sy predicted Manila's composite index would rise beyond\n1,000 points from its current 775.9 mark by year-end.\n    Other brokers were more cautious, saying Aquino had to\nimprove peace and order before investors could treat the\nPhilippines as they would Hong Kong or Tokyo.\n    One broker said he believed about 30 pct of the money going\ninto stocks was now foreign, much of it from fund managers and\ntheir agents based in Hong Kong and New York.\n    Manila Stock Exchange chairman Robert Coyuito told Reuters,\n\"If the peace and order situation really improved the market\ncould move beyond a price-earnings ratio of 20 times.\"\n    \"But all depends on how Congress performs and the local\nelections go,\" he said.\n    A new two-chamber legislature was elected last month and is\ndue to sit on July 27. Local elections are scheduled for\nNovember.\n    PLDT shares closed at 630 pesos a share yesterday, 30 pesos\nabove Wednesday's record close. PLDT share prices have risen\nabout nine-fold in 18 months.\n    San Miguel shares closed at 190 pesos, also a historic\nhigh, brokers said.\n REUTER",

    "title": "CANADIAN TAX REFORM CALLED AN IMPORTANT STEP",
    "content": "Canada's sweeping tax reform package,\nannounced today, is an important step towards a fairer system,\nbut is not as bold a revamp of the tax structure as some had\nexpected, economists and business leaders said.\n    \"It's the biggest step towards tax reform we've taken in a\ngreat many years,\" Merrill Lynch Canada Inc chief economist\nMichael Manford told Reuters.\n    \"But the system is the same old system with a lot of\nimportant changes, as opposed to a brand new system,\" he added.\n(See spotlight index page on ECRA)\n    Manford said changes introduced by Finance Minister Michael\nWilson did not go far enough in simplifying the federal tax\nsystem. They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary\nreform.\n    \"Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than we\nwere led to believe,\" he said.\n    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations\nwhile cutting individual taxes \"is probably an acceptable shift,\"\nsaid Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, an\ninternational mining company.\n    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across\nthe corporate sector, James said. \"So it's not going to hit\nanyone too hard and we will remain competitive.\"\n    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that\nCanada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with\nsweeping reforms in the United States last year.\n    \"The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson\nmoved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System,\" Manford\nsaid.\n    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations\nby about five billion dlrs over the next five years, but\nlowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.\n    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able to\nlower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many\nspecial tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.\n    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, used\nby companies to write off major investments, which some\nbusiness spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.\n    \"That will affect some investment decisions negatively,\" said\nLaurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Association\npresident.\n    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several\ndays to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance\nreductions that will be made over a number of years.\n    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled they\nintend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in\nParliament over the next few months.\n    \"It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab,\" said Liberal leader\nJohn Turner.\n    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax \"a money\nmachine for the minister of finance.\"\n    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include\nadditional products and also promised to introduce a\nbroad-based, multi-staged sales tax.\n    \"It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going to\nsee that very quickly,\" New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent\nsaid.\n    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely to\nprotect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits that\nwill cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Recent government moves to curb capital\ninflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's\nforeign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar\nagainst the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.\n    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the\nreserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two\nweeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the\nU.S. Dollar.\n    Chang said, \"The pace of increase in our reserves is much\nslower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.\"\nHe said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus\nwith the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.\nDlrs a month between January and May.\n    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and\nWest Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.\n    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of\nlocal and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank\npurchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90\npct of the value of a contract.\n    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had\ndrastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to\nimporters and exporters.\n    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar\ntransactions showed a drastic decline with some banks\nregistering a fall of up to 30 pct.\n    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against\nthe U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese\ncents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five\nto eight cents in May.\n    The bank dealers said the central bank, which had\npreviously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1\nbillion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial\ndemand.\n    They said they expected the government to keep the local\ndollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to\nbusinesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of\nmore than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since\nSeptember 1985.\n    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,\nunchanged from yesterday.\n    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,\n\"It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow\nis quite successful.\"\n    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower\nrise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from\nWashington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.\n    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed\nimports of machinery and production equipment because of\nexchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate\nwould help boost imports, particularly from the United States.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Faulty repairs and inadequate inspection\ncaused the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines Co Ltd <JAPN.T> (JAL)\nBoeing 747 which killed 520 people, the Japanese government\nsaid in a final official report.\n    The clear cause of the crash was faulty repair work by the\nBoeing Co <BA>, said Shun Takeda, the ministry of transport\nofficial leading the accident investigation committee.\n    But the report also criticised the ministry's inspectors\nfor failing to carry out a full check of the repairs before\nsigning the clearance sheet.\n    The aircraft hit Mount Osutaka, north of Tokyo, on August\n12, 1985, after a bulkhead separating the pressurised cabin\nfrom the unpressurised tail suddenly burst, fracturing key\nnavigation systems. Only four people survived.\n    A Japan Air Lines spokesman declined comment on the report.\nBoeing is expected to release a statement later today.\n    The report cleared the JAL crew of all responsibility.\n    In a separate set of recommendations, the investigators\nsaid large aircraft operating in Japan should have fail-safe\nsystems, but did not say how this should be done.\n    A press statement by a group of lawyers representing\nvictims of the crash criticised the report for not dealing in\ngreater depth with the fail-safe aspect.\n    The lawyers said Boeing had showed it believed the crash\nwas due to design defects by specifying two design\nmodifications to prevent a recurrence in a memorandum filed in\nKing County, Washington, Superior Court last March 24.\n    They said similar official recommendations for fail-safe\nsystems following two air disasters involving DC-10 aircraft,\nnear Paris in 1974 and at Chicago in 1979, had been rejected\nafter objections from aircraft manufacturers.\n    The government investigators asked the ministry to\nformulate concrete guidelines for its inspectors. An internal\nministry memo earlier this year complained that inspectors were\nleft too much on their own when making aircraft checks.\n    A Boeing team made repairs to the aircraft's aft bulkhead\nunder JAL supervision, and Transport Ministry inspectors\napproved the repairs without actually seeing them, today's\nreport said.\n    The inspectors were unable to check Boeing's work because\nthe part repaired had been covered by a seal, the report said.\n    Over time, cabin pressurisation speeded up the process of\nmetal fatigue in the repaired bulkhead.\n    Boeing issued an official statement on September 6, 1985,\nsaying the 1978 repairs it had carried out were faulty. It did\nnot link them with the crash.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Senior U.S. Officials are looking to Japan\nfor help in buttressing the world economy in the event of an\nAmerican recession next year, Japanese government sources said.\n    During a visit to the U.S. Earlier this month, Economic\nPlanning Minister Tetsuo Kondo was asked by both U.S. Federal\nReserve chairman Paul Volcker and Council of Economic Advisers\nchairman Beryl Sprinkel what Japan could do if the U.S. Enters\nrecession next year.\n    Although Sprinkel indicated that he personally did not\nexpect a recession next year, Volcker seemed to acknowledge\nthat an economic downturn was at least a possibility, the\nsources said.\n    Faced with with a huge budget deficit, the U.S. Has little\nroom to manoeuvre on fiscal policy to counteract any downturn\nthat might occur in 1988.\n    It is also hamstrung as far as monetary policy is concerned\nbecause U.S. Inflation is already showing some signs of picking\nup, one source said.\n    But Japan is also limited in what action it could take to\nhelp counteract a U.S. Recession without running the risk of\noverstimulating its domestic economy and pushing up inflation,\nthe sources said.\n    Money supply growth is accelerating and interest rates are\nat record low levels. In May, M-2 money supply plus\ncertificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 10.2\npct, well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct.\n    Some government sources are also worried that the recently\nannounced 6,000 billion yen emergency economic package could\npush up land prices and the construction sector's inflation.\n    Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate of\nabout 10 pct in April, but that could accelerate to 20 pct\nlater this year under the impact of the emergency package, one\nsource said.\n    The 6,000 billion yen package was generally well received\nin the U.S., Although U.S. Congressmen and businessmen told\nKondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly, sources\nsaid.\n    The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration of\npublic works spending in the package was taking place\nimmediately, they said.\n    U.S. Congressmen were particularly interested in how much\nimpact the package would have on reducing the bilateral trade\nimbalance, a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly,\ngiven the many economic uncertainties involved, the sources\nsaid.\n    While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling in\nterms of volume, some Congressmen expressed concern that it was\nnot falling fast enough.\n     But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a further\nrise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral trade\nimbalance.\n REUTER",

The lower\nlevels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid\nthe tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.\n    Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a\nlarge portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100\ntonnes per day.\n    As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some\n3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by\nthe Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year\nending February 1988.\n    Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to\nallocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.\n    The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,\nbecause the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral\nResources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late\nthis month, Yoot said.\n    The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin\nduring January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.\n REUTER",

Delivery will be determined in\nthe course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three\nparcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.\n    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the\nEgyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of\nSuez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the\ngovernment selling price.\n    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through\nC.Itoh.\n    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light\nfrom Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several\nconstraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels\nand proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.\n    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where\nlifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC\nthen proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.\n    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for\ndelivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to\noffload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.\n    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since\nDecember. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln\ntonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot\nmarket compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.\n REUTER",

    "content": "South Africa recorded annualised\nreal growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this\nyear and the economy should achieve the government's target of\nthree pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.\n    The South African central bank said in its quarterly\nbulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January\nto May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the\nnation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement\nin the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.\n    It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the\nthird and fourth quarters of last year.\n    It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement\nreached with international creditors in March as evidence of\nimproved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.\n    The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most\nrepayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term\nforeign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.\n    South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised\nsurplus on the current account of the balance of payments of\n7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus\nof 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth\nconsecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Philippines' Board of Investments (BOI)\nhas approved new guidelines on making cars but is still\nawaiting rules on the tax component of the programme, trade and\nindustry secretary Jose Concepcion said.\n    He said the authorities were still deciding how much tax\nwill be levied on locally-assembled cars.\n    The new car development programme replaces an earlier\nscheme and is designed to limit the number of car manufacturers\nin the local market.\n    The scheme is to be unveiled before the end of the month.\n    The two accredited local car manufacturers are <Pilipinas\nNissan Inc>, which gets car kits from Nissan Motor Company Ltd\n<NSAN.T> and <Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corp> which\ngets supplies from Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>.\n    Three companies which pulled out due to what they saw as\npoor market conditions were Ford Philippines, a subsidiary of\nFord Motor Co <F>, General Motors Pilipinas, a subsidiary of\nGeneral Motors Corp <GM> and <Delta Motors Corp>.\n    Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, which was the foreign partner\nof Delta Motors, has applied for a place in the new programme\nand is negotiating the purchase of Delta's assembly plant.\n    Concepcion declined to say how many car assemblers would be\nallowed to operate, but said they will be required to finance\n75 pct of the foreign exchange needed to import\ncompletely-knocked-down kits.\n    The balance will be provided by the central bank, he said.\n    The trade minister, who is also chairman of the BOI, said\nthe programme is intended to develop a car parts industry by\nrequiring car firms to use locally-made spare parts. He said\nthe plan should keep car prices at \"reasonable levels.\"\n    Tax currently accounts for 40 pct of the total cost of a\ncar.\n REUTER",

    "content": "French domestic appliance maker Moulinex\n<MOUP.PA> shares continued to fall on the Paris Bourse reaching\nits year's low amid controversy over an auditor's report on\n1987 profit forecasts, dealers said.\n    A Moulinex spokesman said a \"mutilated\" copy of the report by\nParis auditors Syndex, which gave a poor impression of the\ncompany's prospects, had caused the stock to fall sharply.\n    Meanwhile, Moulinex said in a communique that it stood by\nits April forecast of a 1987 parent company net loss of 41.7\nmln francs vs a 226 mln loss in 1986.\n\n    The spokesman said 50 pages of the 200-page report,\ncommissioned by Moulinex's staff/management committee, had been\ncirculated to several Parisian stockbrokers.\n    The Syndex report said the company's 1987 target would be\ndifficult to achieve, thereby causing Moulinex stock to drop\nalmost 13 francs in two days to 75.10 francs per share.\n    A Syndex spokesman said yesterday that the auditors were\n\"shocked\" by the leak of a confidential document and attributed\nit to \"malicious intentions.\" Several Paris brokers said it was\nlikely that corporate \"raiders\" interested in a takeover bid had\nput out the Syndex report to bring down the share price.\n\n    Moulinex shares have fluctuated considerably since the\nbeginning of the year on takeover rumours, reaching a high of\n122 francs.\n    Group president Jean Mantelet, who is 87, said in February\nthat he intended to transfer his 42 pct stake in Moulinex to\nthe company's employees. However, a company statement issued at\nthe same time said a management buy-out was only one of several\noptions.\n    The rest of the group's equity has been held by private\ninvestors since March when <Scovill Inc> of the U.S. Sold its\n20 pct holding in the company.\n\n REUTER",

In the process, prices collapsed\nfrom about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the\norganisation decided to cut production again from last\nSeptember onwards.\n    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.\n    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly\nto 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the\nofficial Saudi Press Agency.\n    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the\nnumber of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.\n\n    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44\nmln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year.

    "content": "An organization of Tennessee\nValley Authority industrial customers said it has joined the\nTVA in asking a court to prevent the U.S. Department of Energy\nfrom witholding contracted payments to TVA.\n    The Tennessee Valley Industrial Committee said it is\nseeking permission to intervene in TVA's federal district court\nlawsuit requesting DOE be enjoined from witholding payments due\nunder \"minimum demand\" provisions of the TVA's contract to\nsupply electricity to uranium enrichment facilities at Oak\nRidge, Tenn., and Paducah, Ky.\n   \n    Such provisions obligate TVA to make available a certain\namount of power and the customer -- in this case the DOE --\nagrees to pay the fixed costs associated with that amount of\npower whether is is used or not.\n    The committee represents 27 large, energy-intensive\nindustries with operations in the TVA service area. These\nindustries, like DOE, are served directly by TVA as opposed to\ngoing through a local distributors.\n    The TVA has said DOE's intention, announced last week, to\nwithhold increasing percentages of its electric bill will\nresult in a revenue shortfall of about 250 mln dlrs and force\nan about six pct rate increase to all other customers.\n Reuter",

They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary\nreform.\n    \"Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than we\nwere led to believe,\" he said.\n    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations\nwhile cutting individual taxes \"is probably an acceptable shift,\"\nsaid Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, an\ninternational mining company.\n    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across\nthe corporate sector, James said. \"So it's not going to hit\nanyone too hard and we will remain competitive.\"\n    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that\nCanada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with\nsweeping reforms in the United States last year.\n    \"The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson\nmoved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System,\" Manford\nsaid.\n    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations\nby about five billion dlrs over the next five years, but\nlowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.\n    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able to\nlower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many\nspecial tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.\n    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, used\nby companies to write off major investments, which some\nbusiness spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.\n    \"That will affect some investment decisions negatively,\" said\nLaurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Association\npresident.\n    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several\ndays to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance\nreductions that will be made over a number of years.\n    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled they\nintend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in\nParliament over the next few months.\n    \"It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab,\" said Liberal leader\nJohn Turner.\n    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax \"a money\nmachine for the minister of finance.\"\n    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include\nadditional products and also promised to introduce a\nbroad-based, multi-staged sales tax.\n    \"It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going to\nsee that very quickly,\" New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent\nsaid.\n    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely to\nprotect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits that\nwill cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls.\n Reuter",

The Ministry of\nAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all\nmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.\n    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences\nof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought\nexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to\nalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.\n    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously\naffected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts\nof the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have\ndried up.\n Reuter",

    "title": "U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES",
    "content": "More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers\nfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes\nthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to other\ninterest rates.\n    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in\nyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers\ntrying to lock into cheap money.\n    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials\nsaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home\nmortgage business.\n    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They\nwere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a\nfew years ago.\n    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,\nmostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\nas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\nportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\ninduce them to retain their accounts.\n    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\nforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\nrates would move in line with the cost of funds.\n    \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"\nsaid a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\nexplaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\noffering variable rate mortgages.\n    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\nhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\nconcede they are being forced to undercut each other still\nmore.\n    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\nthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\nNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\nnew business, officials at all three institutions said.\n    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\nbelow those on the variable rate loans.\n    \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\nrate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\nearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\nnew mortgage loans.\n    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\nloans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our\nmortgage product.\"\n    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\nrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\n    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\nexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\n    \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting\nthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\nof its 1986 volume.\n    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\noffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\nrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\nlender is earning an above average return on assets.\n    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\nthe benefit of cheap money.\n    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\nrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\nthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\nfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\n    Young explained that the company had planned to protect\nitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\ncomplicated hedging instrument.\n    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\nand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\nsaid money market rates were too high to arrange both the\nmortgages and hedge profitably.\n    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\nmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\nmeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\nand selling them to an investor.\n    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\nefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\nmortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular\nagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money\nover the past few years.\n REUTER",

The Dutch\nFinance Ministry declined to comment on the press reports.\n    Newspapers quoted the report, drafted by Finance Minister\nOnno Ruding, as saying unexpected rises in revenue would\ncompensate for excess spending of 3.1 billion guilders.\n    Ruding, putting this year's public sector borrowing\nrequirement 0.1 percentage point below last September's target\nat 7.8 pct, criticised the excess spending but will not seek\nadditional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boost\nin revenue, the report was quoted as saying.\n    Excess spending by the central government was put at 2.8\nbillion guilders, while market factors accounted for another\n300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure.\n    But 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 3.55 billion,\nincluding 1.9 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders in\nincome from natural gas sales.\n    Ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the\n1988 budget with an additional 1.9 billion and the cabinet has\nalready pledged 1.2 billion in cuts to narrow the gap.\n    The cabinet is to discuss in coming months what further\nausterity measures will be needed next year to keep the\ngovernment on target for its 1990 aim of a public sector\nborrowing requirement of no more than 5.25 pct of NNI.\n    Ruding has already met opposition from the Liberal and\nChristian-Democrat factions carrying the government majority in\nparliament to his calls for more spending cuts in the 1988\nbudget to counter a slow-down in economic growth.\n REUTER",

    "title": "SPAIN PLANS TARIFF OVERHAUL FOR POWER UTILITIES",
    "content": "Spain's socialist government is aiming to\nrestore confidence of foreign banks in its power generation\nsector by pushing through a complete reform of the industry's\ntariff structure, a senior government official said.\n    Most foreign banks have been refusing to extend fresh loans\nto the mainly privately-owned sector since Fuerzas Electricas\nde Catalunya S.A. (FECSA), a major utility, defaulted on two\nbillion dlrs of foreign currency debt earlier this year.\n    Secretary of State for the Economy, Guillermo De la Dehesa,\ntold Reuters in an interview that a new government-inspired\ntariff mechanism providing for automatic increases each year\nwould guarantee the long term viability of the industry.\n    He said a bill would be sent before the Spanish Cortes\n(parliament) this summer, enabling tariff increases from next\nyear to be set under the new system.\n    De la Dehesa declined to give technical details of the\nscheme, known here as the \"Marco Estable\" (stable framework), but\nsaid future tariff increases would make up for the failure of\npast adjustments to cover rising costs.\n    \"The utility companies have a captive market and if they are\nassured a satisfactory tariff structure they will have the best\nof all possible worlds to do business in,\" De la Dehesa said.\n    FECSA's debt crisis has caused concern among foreign and\nSpanish bankers who expressed fears that other utility\ncompanies may default for lack of fresh funds unless confidence\nin the industry's future is restored.\n    Spain's 14 leading power utilities have massive debts, with\nshort and medium term exposure of 4,377 billion pesetas at the\nend of last year. A significant proportion of it is in foreign\ncurrency, bankers say.\n    The new tariff plan, currently being discussed with\nrepresentatives of the utility industry and Spanish bankers,\nwould shortly be presented to foreign creditors, De la Dehesa\nsaid.\n    FECSA's problems were precipitated in February when the\nstock exchange suspended trading in the company's stock on the\ngrounds that it could not meet its debts.\n     \"FECSA was a special case,\" De la Dehesa said, \"but the banks\ntook fright and extended the crisis to the rest of the utility\nsector. We really did not expect this.\"\n    Much foreign bank lending to the utility sector has been on\nthe strength of a government commitment made to international\nbankers at a presentation in London in 1983 to support the\nindustry.\n    \"I think if foreign banks were lending on the basis of\ndeclarations by our energy authorities in London, they will\nhave all the more reason to do so when the new tariff system is\npassed into law,\" De la Dehesa said.\n     \"This is going to be a palpable fact, not just a\ndeclaration,\" he added.\n    De la Dehesa said he believed that once confidence was\nrestored in the sector as a whole, FECSA's debt problems would\nbe quickly solved.\n    A recently formed steering committee representing FECSA's\nforeign creditors is due to meet FECSA managers in Barcelona on\nTuesday for a round of talks on rescheduling the ailing\nutility's debt.\n    FECSA's General Manager, Jose Zaforteza, told Reuters he\nthought the climate of the talks would be greatly improved by\nthe new tariff proposals.\n    \"You cannot go far wrong when you are managing an electrical\nutility provided the tariffs you charge are sufficient to cover\nyour costs,\" Zaforteza said.\n    The General Manager of the Madrid branch of a U.S. Bank\nwhich has lent money to FECSA said there would be little\nsignificant progress in the rescheduling talks until details of\nthe tariff proposals were known.\n    \"We cannot make any projections about FECSA's ability to pay\nits debts unless we know what the tariffs are going to be,\" he\nsaid.\n    \"If you make annual increases over a period of years of\nfour, five or six pct, in each case it's a completely different\nball game,\" he said.\n REUTER",

The tax\nreform does not encompass corporate taxation.\n    The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the package\nwould be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowances\ncurrently granted to diverse interest groups.\n    A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenues\nresulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of the\npackage.\n    This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs,\nwhich the government would have to decide how to cover, either\nby raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts.\n    The package favoured by Eyskens, who has described Belgium\nas a \"fiscal Himalaya,\" is the least costly of the 11 scenarios\nprepared. It envisages three marginal rates, or tax thresholds,\nof 30 pct, 40 pct and 50 pct. This compares with 13 currently,\nof which the highest is 71.6 pct.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials\nwere not available for comment on market rumors that it is\ninterested in acquiring Reed International plc <REED.L>.\n    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial\nadviser, declined comment.\n    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said\nthe rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has\nannounced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover\nattempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.\"It's completely\ninconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they\ndrop the recapitalization,\" he said.\n    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.\n    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a\nU.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a\ndeclaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011\nin light of the recapitalization.\n    Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon\nBrothers Inc <SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the\ncase, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount\nof the debenture. In addition, British Printing and\nCommunications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face\namount, Harcourt said.\n    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the\ncourt decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,\nthey could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.\n    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not\nrequired to issue common to debenture holders who did not\nconvert prior to June eight.\n    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed\nby brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors\nthat Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New\nYork said \"there's no basis to think that it's us.\"\n Reuter",

They said that they were not consulted on the\nsale of Citicorp's local subsidiary, Citibank N.A. Ltd, to\nSouth Africa's First National Bank <BCLJ.J>.\n    The letter, signed by most of the bank's 175 staff, hints\nat legal action against Citicorp unless it reviews the\ndisinvestment arrangement.\n    \"We are seriously considering legal action,\" a senior\nCitibank employee told Reuters. \"There has been no consultation\nwith South African staff and that runs contrary to American\ncorporate thinking in this country,\" he added.\n    Citicorp announced the 130 mln rand cash sale on Tuesday\nwith an effective date of July 1.\n    First National Bank's managing director, Chris Ball, said\nhis bank was essentially buying the skills of Citibank's\nspecialist employees and disclosed that the American bank's\nassets in South Africa totalled only 15 mln rand.\n    Ball indicated that the bank's staff had been told of the\nsale and agreed to stay on in the bank's employ.\n    Citibank's staff, 40 pct of whom are black, have complained\nthat the disinvestment accord bars local employees from jobs\nwith Citicorp anywhere in the world for five years.\n    They say that this provision amounts to a restraint clause\nwhich is legally challengeable. This could threaten the\ndivestment plan, say industry sources, since most of the\npurchase price, as Ball said, is for employee skills and\nexpertise and not assets.\n    The Citibank employee challenge is seen as more important\nthan a previous, ultimately unsuccessful, challenge on job\nsecurity issues by General Motors employees after the U.S.\nAutomaker announced its pull out, because valuable managers and\nother key staff are involved in protest.\n    The employees assert that the Citicorp sale, unlike similar\ndisinvestment moves announced this week by <Ford Motor Co> and\n<ITT Corp>, include no portion of South African profits for\nlocal employees or black community projects.\n    \"We always thought they would offer a settlement to staff\nhere in keeping with their image as an equal opportunity\nemployer,\" said a senior black employee, adding \"We had no idea\nthat the age of slavery was still alive.\"\n REUTER",

Earlier this\nyear, Midland Bank Plc pulled out of equity market making\nbecause it did not believe the return justified the costs\ninvolved in maintaining and developing a market share.\n    Lloyds Treasurer Alan Moore subsequently told Reuters that\nthe decision was taken at a board meeting earlier today and had\nbeen under discussion for some time.\n    He said the move was not a reaction to any losses sustained\nin the trading of Eurobonds or gilts but rather a result of a\n\"strategic review\" of the future of Lloyds involvement in these\nmarkets. In the end, Lloyds decided these markets did not\nrepresent \"an attractive return to our shareholders,\" he said.\n    He noted that Lloyds had not expected its U.K. Government\nbond operations would be profitable in the early stages,\nalthough he declined to discuss the finances of the operation.\n    \"This is an overcrowed market,\" Moore said of the U.K.\nGovernment bond market, which began Big Bang with 27 market\nmakers. Lloyds withdrawal now leaves the number at 26.\n    Market participants noted that Lloyds was the only one of\nthe clearing banks which did not buy a jobber (middle man) or\nbroker before Big Bang.\n    Under the old system, the gilt market operated under a\nseparate system which involved separate functions for jobbers\nand brokers. Now these tasks have been taken up by market\nmakers acting as both.\n    Moore said that one reason Lloyds decided to withdraw from\nthese markets was that they could no longer justify the\ncommitment of capital that was required to maintain these\noperations.\n    He said Lloyds would make every effort to redeploy\nemployees in these areas within the bank.\n REUTER",

Cool and rainy\nweather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are\nrated as slightly below normal.\n    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with\nheavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.\n    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it\nwas mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which\ncontinued to slow down beet growth and often made field work\nimpossible.\n    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was\nfavourable for beet growth, Licht said.\n    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring\nbeet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.\n    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,\nit was warm with showers over most areas and weather was\ngenerally good for the emergence and growth of beets.\n    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall\nboosted beet development.\n    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain.

    "content": "The Paris Club of creditor nations agreed\nto a major rescheduling of Uganda's and Mozambique's\ngovernment-to-government debts, the Club said in a statement.\n    At meetings here this week, both countries were accorded\nterms that were more generous than usually granted by the Club.\nUganda was given 15 years to repay its debts with a six-year\ngrace period while Mozambique was accorded an exceptionally\nlong 20-year period, with 10 years' grace.\n    The Club said it approved of both countries' economic and\nfinancial programs and would therefore make a contribution to\nimprove their external payments prospects.\n    It said both countries faced heavy debt service obligations\nand low per capita income, adding the solution of the\ncountries' debt problems would take a number of years.\n    The statement also said Mozambique's limited debt service\ncapacity made borrowing from the International Monetary Fund in\nthe upper credit tranches \"inappropriate.\"\n    No details were available from the countries' embassies nor\nfrom the Club on the amounts involved, but last week the\nUgandan Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said he was hoping\nfor a rescheduling of 120 mln dlrs. Uganda's total foreign debt\nis estimated at some 1.5 billion dlrs.\n    A French Finance Ministry statement issued the same time as\nthe Paris Club statement, said France had formally agreed with\nGabon to reschedule bilateral unpaid debt amounting to about\n440 mln francs.\n    The bilateral agreement, covering payments due to have been\nmade by May 31 this year, follows the Paris Club's January\ndecision to grant Gabon an extended repayment period for its\ngovernment-to-government debt.\n    The ministry said French aid to Gabon in 1987, within the\nframework of the country's economic recovery program, amounts\nto about 1.67 billion francs.\n REUTER",

    "title": "U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING",
    "content": "U.S. crude oil prices are at their\nhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC\nmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any\npolicy changes from the session.\n    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the\norganization's accord in December, have risen on technical\nfactors within the market and concerns about supplies because\nof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the\nGulf.\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading\naround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile\nExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its\nhighest level since January 1986.\n    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's\noil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to\nbe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production\nagreement may only need a slight review.\n    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation\nof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to\na desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.\n    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon\nafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased\ntension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\nshould begin easing.\n    \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\nto in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a\nvice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\n    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\n18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\n16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\nbarrels in the fourth quarter.\n    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\nfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\n    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\nAlgeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\nreduction in output.\n    \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\ntrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\nOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman\nBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\n    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\nas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\n    \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\nofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\ncommitted to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,\nanalyst with L.F. Rothschild.\n    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\nin September to re-evaluate market conditions.\n    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\nfourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\nday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\nbarrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\nof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\n    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\nmeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\noffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\nthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\nproducers receive less money for their oil.\n    \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"\nsaid Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n    \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\nproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\nas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\ndlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he\nsaid.\n    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\n    \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\nGulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\nSecurites.\n    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\nregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration\nis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the\nU.S. flag, with naval escorts.\n    \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis\nlike this, and just general nervousness over an incident that\ncould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.\n Reuter",

    "title": "FURTHER US DEFENSE WRITEOFFS LIKELY, ANALYSTS SAY",
    "content": "The tug-of-war over who pays to develop\nnew weapons--contractors or the government--is likely to lead\nto more writeoffs by defense firms, analysts said.\n    Singer Co <SMF> and Northrop Corp <NOC> recently announced\nplanned second quarter writeoffs related to costs of major\ndefense programs under fixed-price government contracts.\n    \"It's a case of companies paying for things that in a\ndifferent environment the Defense Department would have paid\nfor,\" said Howard Mager of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities\nCorp.\n    In recent years, the Defense Department, DOD, has increased\ncompetitive bidding for weapons contracts and has asked\ncontractors to pay more of the costs of developing weapons\nprograms.\n    The moves have helped cut waste and abuse by contractors\nbut have also dictated that the firms assume much more risk,\nanalysts said.\n    \"It's a stricter environment,\" said Anthony Hatch of Argus\nResearch Corp. \"Contractors are absorbing more of the cost and\nmore of risk and that's likely to be the trend for some time to\ncome.\"\n    The trend will probably lead to further writeoffs, the\nanalysts said. Programs most prone, they agreed, are the\nAdvanced Tactical Fighter, ATF, a new generation,\nhigh-technology fighter plane being developed for the U.S. Air\nForce, the C-17 air transport plane and the Light Helicopter\nExperimental, LHX, under development for the Army.\n    Other programs may also be affected, they said.\n    The Air Force is expected to order 750 of the advanced\nfighter planes in the 1990s at a cost of up to 40 billion dlrs,\nanalysts have said. Two teams of contractors are competing for\na contract to develop a prototype ATF.\n    Lockheed Corp <LK>, General Dynamics Corp <GD> and Boeing\nCo <BA> are teamed in competition against Northrop Corp <NOC>\nand McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> on ATF.\n    The two teams fighting for an award to develop the LHX are\nBell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc <TXT>, coupled with\nMcDonnell Douglas, and United Technologies Corp's <UTX>\nSikorsky paired with Boeing.\n    The C-17 is a four-engine transport plane. McDonnell\nDouglas's Douglas Aircraft Co is working on two test planes,\nand a production award for up to 210 of the aircraft should be\nmade by late 1989, a Douglas Aircraft spokesman said.\n    Under the government's new procedures, contractors can\nspend hundreds of millions of dollars on development and  \ntypically recoup their investments during production.\n    But now the government sometimes awards production to a\nsecond contractor who did not develop the system. General\nElectric Co <GE>, for example, developed the F404 engine for\nthe Navy. But two weeks ago, the Pentagon awarded 30 pct of\nF404 production to United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney.\n    Such tactics have increased competition but the government\nnow risks decimating the industry by making it too competitive,\nsaid Michael LaTronica of Redding Research Group.\n    \"Two years ago, defense contractors were their own worst\nenemies. They were not cost efficient,\" LaTronica said. \"Now\nDOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the other\nway that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry as\na national resource.\"\n    While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits in\nrecent years, aerospace and defense has exported more products\nthan it imported, he noted.\n    LaTronica and others said, however, that changes in\ngovernment procurement may be coming.\n    \"I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation,\"\nsaid John Diamantis, defense analyst at Pershing and Co.\n    He said that some small defense electronics firms believe\nthe Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy and\nperhaps start paying more development money.\n    Redding Research's LaTronica, who still likes the industry\ndespite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs,\nsaid, \"There's been a swing in sentiment. The defense bashing\npsychology of the last few years is starting to shift.\"\n    LaTronica noted that one government official has recently\nsuggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should get\nsole production of the plane for a specified time.\n    The investments are large. The Lockheed, General Dynamics,\nBoeing ATF team, for example, is spending 691 mln dlrs just to\ndevelop the prototype.\n    The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made is\nthat companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program but\ninstead will wait for a second source production award.\n    \"But it may take a company going bust to really change\npeople's thinking,\" LaTronica said.\n Reuter",

    "title": "MERCK <MRK>, SQUIBB <SQB> BENEFIT FROM STUDY",
    "content": "Merck Co <MRK> and Squibb Corp <SQB>\nwill benefit from a study that shows lower levels of blood\ncholesterol slows the build-up of fat in the heart's arteries,\nlowering the risk of heart attacks, industry analysts said.\n    Both companies have developed drugs that slow the body's\nproduction of cholesterol although Merck is about 18 months\nahead of Squibb with a drug expected to be approved this year.\n    \"Certainly this study will create greater acceptance of\nanti-cholesterol drugs,\" said Robert Uhl, a drug analyst at F.\nEberstadt Fleming.\n    Although neither company's drug was used in the study,\nwhich was conducted by a team of scientists at the University\nof Southern California School of Medicine, both are leaders in\na new class of drugs that fight cholesterol.\n    The study, reported in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation, showed lower levels of cholesterol, achieved\nthrough a combination of drugs and special diet, slowed and in\nsome cases reversed the build up of fatty deposits in the\nheart's arteries.\n    Such build up leads to heart attacks, the leading cause of\ndeath in the U.S.\n    Health officials have said lower levels of cholesterol\ncould immediately benefit six mln Americans who suffer symptoms\nof coronary artery disease. The study advocated reduction of\ncholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.\n    As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industry\nanalysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug\ntherapy will gain wider acceptance.\n    In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of\nSanford C. Bernstein said \"the culture can shift in terms of\ndrug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally\nalter their diets\".\n    The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600\nmln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market,\nanalysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrs\nannually in about next five years.\n    The drugs used in the study, in combination with the low\ncholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, and\ncolestipol, a drug Upjohn Co <UPJ> has sold since 1977.\n    But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say\nthe new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. \"Niacin leads to\ntremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomach\nupset,\" Crossen said.\n    Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to\n30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. \"It isn't fun\nto take,\" Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks\nrestricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under\n10 mln dlrs a year.\n    In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have\nlittle side effects because they target a key factor in the\nbody's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the\nliver.\n   \n    \"Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather\nvariable,\" said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vice\npresident at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt a\nclear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.\n    Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a\ntablet form swallowed once or twice a day.\n    Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from an\nadvisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this\nyear and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late\nsummer or fall.\n    Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted for\nregulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988,\nSanders said.\n    Warner Lambert Co <WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co <BMY> also\nhave cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug,\nbut only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of\ncholesterol inhibitors.\n Reuter",

    "content": "Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln\nounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln\nin 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson\nMatthey Plc said.\n    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation\nin Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in\nconsumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest\nsingle application for platinum.\n    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,\nClark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released\nin London today.\n    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further\nincrease in investment buying and may well be cautious.\n    He said South Africa was the most likely source of\nadditional supplies and will need to increase output by about\n500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.\n    The capital investment required to produce the additional\noutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political\nclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.\n    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the\n1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,\nClark said.\n    \"The very probability of a growth in demand set against the\nmassive investment required for expansion - and that expansion\nonly being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to\nconclude that the price of platinum will be substantially\nunderpinned in the medium to long-term,\" Clark said.\n REUTER",

    "content": "European coffee roasters and traders\nhave agreed to propose a new formula for calculating\nInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee\nTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.\n    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee\nFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.\n    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and\nwould give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an\nunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current\ncoffee agreement, van Horick said.\n    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the\nICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new\nagreement, van Horick said.\n    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when\nprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in\nBrazil.\n    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and\nproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.\n    \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the\nformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal\nleaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.\n    \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not\nreflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula\nbuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost\neveryone.\"\n    Although full implications of the new formula have still to\nbe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as\nColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly\nhigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El\nSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.\n    Because the proposal provides that future quota\ndistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it\nshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing\nso would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.\n    \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least\na fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the\nSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a\nnew quota formula, \" van Horick said.\n    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.\n    \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If\nthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two\nmonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we might\njust get an agreement,\" van Horick added.\n Reuter",

In a prepared\nstatement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said the\nbank had a \"relatively small position in these two overcrowded\nmarkets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to\nopportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders\ninvestment.\"\n    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-term\nsecurities trading, swaps and other treasury products.\n    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that the\ndecision was forward looking and followed a \"strategic review\" of\nthe prospects for Lloyds in these markets. \"We decided the\nreturn just was not attractive,\" he said.\n    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds board\nthis morning, Moore said that it had been under consideration\nfor some time.\n    He denied that the move was a \"reaction to events in the\ntrading room\" although he acknowledged that the bank's gilt\noperations were not profitable in the early stages of the new\nmarket.\n    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, Lloyds\nMerchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which he\nsaid were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.\nFor all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mln\nstg. \"Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses,\" Brown\nsaid, noting that they are minuscule when compared with the\nbank's exposure to Latin America.\n    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increase\ntheir provisions against bad loans to third world countries\nsince Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to its\nprovisions in mid-May.\n    National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBL.L>, the largest of the\nclearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to follow\nCiticorp's <CCI> move earlier this week when it said it was\nadding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.\n    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin America\nafter Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.\n    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Moore\ndenied that today's action had any connection. \"It is totally\nunrelated,\" he said.\n    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time the\nannouncement was made. But market participants were\ndumbfounded.\n    \"We only heard the news about 20 minutes before the\nannouncement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if I\nstill have job,\" said one trader at Lloyds who declined to be\nidentified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all it\ncould to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in other\nparts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of these\nmarkets was relatively small, other market participants,\nparticularly in gilts, were unnerved.\n    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comes\nduring a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets have\nbeen battered by the lack of investor participation, following\nthe June 11 U.K. general election.\n    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that a\nreturn of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavy\ndemand. These expectations have failed to be met and both\nmarkets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.\n    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it was\nexperiencing problems with its gilt operations and officials\nhave never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.\n    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problems\nfacing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up its\nown team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase a\nbroker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.\n    Under the old system, these functions have been conducted\nseparately but now market makers perform both tasks.\n    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expressed\ndoubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27\nmarket makers, even if turnover increased substantially.\n    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe that\nsome of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully.\n Reuter",

Donald Riegle, a Michigan\nDemocrat, and Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican, would\nmake it illegal for anyone to receive or pass on inside\ninformation even if the person providing the information did\nnot use it to make a securities transaction.\n    Federal law enforcement officials have said a definition of\ninsider trading would be useful because it is a difficult crime\nto prove.\n   \n    Cox said the SEC was having success in its insider trading\ncases despite the lack of a clear definition.\n    He became acting chairman of the agency when chairman John\nShad left to become U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.\n    President Reagan nominated Northwestern University law\nprofessor David Ruder as SEC chairman on Wednesday, but he may\nnot be confirmed by the Senate for several weeks.\n   \n    Riegle, the chairman of the Senate securities subcommittee,\nsaid he wanted to act on the legislation this year, but Thomas\nMoore, a member of the President's Council of Economic\nAdvisors, said action should be delayed until the Supreme Court\nruled on the appearl of an insider trading conviction by former\nWall Street Journal reporter R.

We hope this need will not be affected negatively\nby trade legislation.\"\n    Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens -\nespecially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign\nexchange not only to service the debt but also to continue\nnational development progress.\"\n    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he\ntermed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effort\nto water down some of the objectionable provisions in the\nlegislation.\n    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez\nsaid as yet \"the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.\"\n reuter",

    "content": "Brazil's crisis-ridden motor industry\n-- which is dominated by the subsidiaries of Volkswagen AG\n<VOWG.F>, Fiat Spa <FIAT.MI>, General Motor Corp <GM> and Ford\nCo <F> -- has not made a single domestic sale for the last four\ndays, and several assembly lines will stop shortly, industry\nspokesmen said.\n    The motor manufacturers have been feeling the pinch for\nmonths, with demand slumping as the country heads into\nrecession.\n    But the industry hit a fresh problem when dealers decided\non Tuesday to stop buying any cars or trucks to protest high\ngovernment taxes on vehicles. The dealers' decision was sparked\nby a 33 pct increase in car prices authorized last week by the\ngovernment to cover industry's rising costs.\n    Spokesman Marcio Stefani of the Brazilian Association of\nAutmotive Vehicle Distributors said dealers felt their\nlivelihood was at stake -- cars aren't selling because they\ncost too much.\n    \"It is a question of our survival. The price of cars in\nBrazil has reached an insupportable level,\" he said. A GM Opala\nDiplomata, he said, costs 30,000 dlrs in Brazil, while an\nequivalent car in the United States would cost about 10,000\ndlrs.\n    The National Association of Automotive Vehicle\nManufacturers said that if the trade's boycott continues for\nanother week, consequences will be serious.\n    Association spokesman Fred Carvalho told Reuters, \"The\nconsequences will first of all be collective holidays then\nlay-offs and a more and more catastrophic situation.\"\n    A spokesman for Ford Brasil said it would tell about half\nof its 21,000 workforce to take holidays June 29-July 13.\n    Fiat announced yesterday that it would give 2,000 workers a\nmonth's holiday, from July 6, halting production for the\ndomestic market.\n    Carvalho said the industry was working at 3,500 vehicles a\nday, below its 1986 average of 4,700 and capacity of 5,100.\n    During last year's Cruzado Plan price freeze, feverish\ndemand far outstripped supply. The industry says it could have\nsold many more cars than it produced, but was constrained by a\nlack of parts.\n    Today the picture is completely different after months of\nraging inflation and demand has all but disappeared.\n    Carvalho said the government taxes on cars added 138 pct to\nthe cost of the vehicle. He described the taxes as \"the highest\nin the universe and the galaxy.\"\n    Domestic car sales during the first five months of this\nyear slipped to their lowest level for a decade, 241,632 units\ncompared with 382,182 units during the same period last year.\n    On the bright side, exports are booming -- sales abroad in\nMay totalled 242 mln dlrs, a record figure.\n    The motor industry is critical of the government of\nPresident Jose Sarney, which has gained a reputation as an\nindifferent manager of the economy.\n    Last month Volkswagen said it was postponing indefinitely\ninvestments of 150 mln dlrs planned for this year.\n    Wolfgang Sauer, president of Volkswagen do Brasil, said the\ngovernment had created a crisis of confidence.\n    Brazil's motor industry employs more than 150,000 people.\n Reuter",

    "content": "U.S. Comptroller of the Currency\nRobert Clarke said his office is expanding a plan giving\ntemporarily ailing but well managed national banks extra time\nto come into compliance with its minimum capital requirements.\n    The policy, which originally was intended to give well run\nbanks in economically depressed areas more time to rebuild\ndepleted capital levels, will be broadened to apply to all\nnational banks, Clarke said in a speech to a financial seminar.\nA text of his remarks was made public today.\n    The comptroller's office will extend the application\ndeadline for the plan to Dec. 31, 1989 from Dec. 31, 1987.\n    It will extend to 1995 from 1993 the deadline for banks to\nboost their capital levels to the required minimum level.\n    Finally, it will eliminate a current requirement that a\nbank have capital of at least four pct to participate in the\ncapital forbearance plan.\n    \"In theory, a bank could be allowed to continue to operate\nwith nearly zero capital if we approve its plan to rebuild its\ncapital base,\" Clarke said, though he added that a bank in that\nsituation would have a have \"a virtually ironclad plan for a\nprompt restoration of capital\" to be accepted.\n    The critical linkage to forbearance is that the\nfundamentals must be in place to assure that the bank can\nsurvive: in short, capable management and financial prospects,\"\nClarke said.\n    He said the program will continue to be closed to insolvent\nbanks.\n Reuter",

    "title": "CHRYSLER <C> MOVE CONTINUES TREND",
    "content": "Chrysler Corp is taking a small step\naway from automobiles and towards military contracting with the\npurchase of Electrospace Systems Inc <ELE>, analysts said.\n    \"A chief goal of Chrysler is to gain military business for\ntheir Gulfstream planes and this should help that cause\ndramatically,\" said analyst Gary Glaser at First Boston Corp.\n    Chrysler, which bought Gulfstream Aerospace Corp in 1985,\nearlier said Electrospace agreed to be acquired in a friendly\nmerger for about 367 mln dlrs.\n    Analysts said the merger continues a trend in the\nautomobile industry of diversification away from carmaking.\n    General Motors Corp <GM> paid about five billion dlrs for\nHughes Aircraft, an aerospace company, in 1985. A year earlier\nit bought Electronic Data Systems, a data processing firm, for\nabout 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co <F> has added First Nationwide\nSavings as part of a move into financial services.\n    Ford, which has a huge stockpile of cash, has indicated its\ninterest in aerospace with Lockheed Corp <LK> once rumored as a\npossible target.\n    Both Ford and Lockheed have denied the rumors, according to\nanalysts. Ford has about 9.5 billion dlrs of cash and\nsecurities on hand, one analyst said.\n    \"The overall strategic thrust (within the car industry)\nis to become somewhat less sensitive to the vagaries of the\nautomobile sales cycle,\" said analyst Jack Kirnan at Kidder\nPeabody and Co. \"One way companies feel they can do it,\nparticularly GM and Chrysler, is by diversifying into\naerospace,\" Kirnan said. Ford has been \"a little bit of a\nlaggard\" in that area, he said, which has been a concern to\nsome investors.\n    Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985,\nwhen it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs.\n    Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price for\nElectrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlay\nfor the company. Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of\n191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3.\n    Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting the\nRichardson, Texas, electronics firm because it is also buying\nAmerican Motors Corp <AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a deal\nset to close later this year.\n    \"Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for a\nyear or more and will absorb a lot of debt,\" Kirnan said,\nmaking them the most heavily leveraged auto company.\n    But other analysts said the relative small size of\nElectrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb.\n    Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributed\nsignificantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mln\ndlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year.\n    In a statement, Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace's\nsales were to the military.\n    In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business,\nChrysler said it believes electronics technology will help the\nautomobile business.\n    Robert Miller Jr, Chrysler Corp vice chairman, said that\nGulfstream's business, for example, involves electronics,\ncomposites and aerodynamic design. \"Those will all be important\ntechnologies for winning in the automobile business in the\n1990s,\" Miller told Reuters. Electrospace should add\nsignificantly to the electronics area, he said.\n    Miller said Electrospace earnings last year were hurt by\none-time items and but should recover this year.\n    Miller said cash on hand will be used to pay for\nElectrospace.\n    \"They have a substantial presence in Washington with 150 or\nmore professional people. They also have accounting systems in\nTexas to manage their business with the Defense Department,\" he\nsaid.\n    Both should be important in moving Gulfstream into the\nmilitary market. \"Gulfstream traditionally has been aimed more\nat the commercial market, which is a different kettle of fish,\"\nMiller said.\n Reuter",

    "content": "The Pentagon has stopped approving\nany new military contracts to Japan's Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T>\nover a Toshiba subsidiary's transfer of submarine technology to\nthe Soviet Union, a senior defense official said.\n    \"We are not approving any new contracts (with Toshiba)\npending a satisfactory resolution of this entire matter,\" Deputy\nAssistant Defense Secretary Stephen Bryen told Reuters,\nconfirming published reports on the matter.\n    The temporary ban, which Bryen said has been in effect\nunofficially since April, could cost Toshiba hundreds of mlns\nof dlrs in electronics business with the Pentagon, including a\npending 100 mln dlr Air Force deal for small computers.\n    Bryen said the U.S. military services have not signed any\ncontracts with Toshiba since April, when publicity arose over\nsubsidiary Toshiba Machine Co's alleged sale to Moscow of\nmilling machines which will grind silent submarine propellers.\n    The Japanese government has been investigating the case and\nit was previously reported that Toshiba Machine sold four large\nmilling machines to the Soviet Union in late 1983 or early \n1984.\n    But Bryen told Reuters in an interview that the Pentagon\nhas now been informed by Japanese police that at least four\nmore smaller machines capable of making such precision\npropellers were also sold to the Kremlin, apparently in 1984.\n    \"There may be even more beyond that. I don't know yet,\" Bryen\nsaid.\n    Toshiba is known to be seeking a U.S. Air Force contract\nfor 90,000 lap-top computers worth some 100 mln dlrs. The Air\nForce has called for new bids on that contract, partly because\nof the Toshiba investigation, Pentagon officials said.\n    The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the\ncomputer contract is also being re-advertised for bidding\nbecause of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised by\nU.S. import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics.\n    Two days ago, three U.S. senators said they wanted a\ntemporary ban on all U.S. imports of Toshiba Corp products,\nincluding television sets and videotape recorders.\n    Senators Jake Garn of Utah, Richard Shelby of Alabama and\nJohn Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment to\na major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer.\n    The Navy is reported to be furious over the technology\ntransfer, and Pentagon officials have told Reuters that some of\nthe state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted on\nSoviet attack submarines.\n    The Japanese government has already prohibited Toshiba\nMachine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for one\nyear.\n    The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk was\ninvolved in the original technology transfer, providing vital\ncomputer software to be used with the Japanese milling\nequipment.\n    But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryen\nsaid that it apparently was not involved in the alleged more\nrecent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment.\n Reuter",

    "title": "NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA",
    "content": "President Reagan's nominee as top\npoliceman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an\nagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock\nprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the\nglobalization of financial markets.\n    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at\nNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday\nto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission.\n    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed\nJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record\nsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.\n    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its\ninvestigators have probed into the most colossal insider\ntrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.\n    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in\nrecent months as a growing number of well known traders and\nprominent investment banking firms have been charged with\nwrongdoing.\n    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after\nIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock\nspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators\nand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal\nprofits after being charged with insider trading.\n    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new\nphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by\ncomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in \nsecurities, options and futures. The price gyrations have\ncombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\nvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\nlawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\ntakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\nsteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\nexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\nfor an international securities marketplace in which trading\noccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\nopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\nU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\ndisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\neliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\nspur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\nreview of hostile corporate takeovers.\n    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\ninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\nthe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n    In line with the views of other top administration\nofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\nbattles over new federal regulations.\n    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\ntrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\ntopped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\nadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\nRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\nsignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\nlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\nfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\nagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n    The agency is one of the few in the government that\nactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\nfew years because of fees it charges public companies,\ninvestment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\nmeaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\npresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\nfor policy differences alone.\n    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\npolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\neach year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\nto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\nin large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\nmarket manipulations by large investment firms.\n    The agency requires public companies and investment\nvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\ntheir financial condition and to disclose changes in their\ncondition any time they issue new securities.\n    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\nregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\nit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\nmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\nbecome the nation's 35th president.\n    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\nfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\nfirst term and was Reagan's director of the Central\nIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\n Reuter",

    "content": "The Administration asked Congress to\nreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it\ninto line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade\nRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said.\n    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more\naccurately define new composites, items not widely traded when\nthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.\n    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is\ncalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet\nthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they\nshould pay about the same rates of duties.\n    Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to\ndeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of\ndiffering systems which they now face.\"\n    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational\nnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.\n    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on\ndata from tariff schedules and the new system will improve\nknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.\n    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under\nthe new system, with about half expected to join the system by\nJanuary 1988.\n reuter",

They are worried that it might take a long\ntime to persuade the other banks to join the deal.\n    Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus, who had not\nmet before, mostly discussed Argentina's political and economic\nsituation. Alfonsin, who is beginning a four-day private visit\nto the U.S., was in Philadelphia to speak to the private World\nAffairs Council, a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing\npublic awareness of international affairs.\n    In his speech, Alfonsin said economic integration is the\nonly way for Latin America to overcome its current crisis.\n    \"This (economic integration) is probably the most audacious\nchallenge facing Latin America this century, perhaps the most\naudacious of our history,\" he said.\n Reuter",

Pipelines also\ntransport its own gas to customers.\n    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERC\nguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the\nregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for\ngas it has bought but could not sell.\n    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay\ncontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term\ncontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as\ncustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.\n    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that\nTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to\nopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.\n    But Tenneco today said open access \"is one of the steps\nFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC\nis moving the industry through this restructuring now, even\nbefore all transitional problems are solved.\"\n    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure\nunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure\nfor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from\nLouisiana and Texas up to New England.\n    \"We remain convinced that the most critical transitional\nissue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by\nFERC in the near future.\n    \"A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the\nindustry's continued ability to provide its customers with\nreliable natural gas,\" said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co\npresident R.C.

    "content": "The economy faces lackluster growth\nand the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement\nin U.S. exports should falter, economists say.\n    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness\nin the key housing and auto sectors and could be further\nhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.\n    \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength\nto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle\nGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official.\n    The Commerce Department said this week that the economy\ngrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but\na U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.\n    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending\nrose a weak 0.1 per cent.\n    \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --\nare faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \"\nMartin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,\ntold Reuters.\n    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow\nbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.\n    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,\nreturning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost\npersonal income and consumption, he says.\n    \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to\nkeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\"\nGramley said.\n    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters\nthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the\nresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last\nand said the recovery was showing anemia.\n    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace\nof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into\nmonetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be\naccommodative.\n    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct\nforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if\nthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add\nto the risk of a recession.\n    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May\ncame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an\ninventory overhang still exists.\n    He says the boost in production came from smaller\nindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have\nimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.\n    \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in\neconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a\nrecession,\" Mauro said.\n    In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl\nSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the\ntrade deficit will continue to improve.\n    \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and\ninto 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.\n    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in\ninflation.\n    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers\nInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5\nto five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after\na 1.1 pct increase in 1986.\n    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil\nand energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.\n    \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets\nout of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he\nwould like the Fed to tighten credit.\n    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the\ndollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says\na prominent international banker.\n    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National\nPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and\nthe mark will continue for years because the United States is\nthe world's largest debtor nation.\n    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a\nfurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief that\nthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.\n\"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.\n Reuter",

    "content": "The six basis point rise of the past\nmonth in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a\nseries of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the\ndollar holds firm.\n    \"Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis\npoints over the last month, largely over indications that\ninflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing\nU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,\" Samuel Kahan, chief\nfinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government\nSecurities, said.\n    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in\nthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern is\nwhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the\nlonger term.\n    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has\nbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than the\nbeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.\n    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down\n1.5 pct, respectively.\n    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money\nsupply announced this week was \"surprising, much larger than\nexpected,\" according to Kahan. \"Unless quickly reversed,\" such\na trend \"will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,\"\nKahan said.\n    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which\nKahan said have \"slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board\nannual targets,\" the consequences could be a hint of economic\nweakness down the road, he said.\n    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for\nfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,\nanalysts said.\n    September T-bonds \"are up almost six points since about May\n18,\" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September\nbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93\nin mid-June, Duggan said.\n    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,\nand bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through\nchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted\nabove the 93 level.\n    \"The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken\nout before this activity is anything other than a trading range\nmarket,\" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst\nBrian Singer said.\n    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.\ncurrency has made little headway of late, analysts said.\n    \"The critical variable remaining in the market is the value\nof the dollar,\" Kahan said.\n    Additional influences next week will be possible\ndevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact\nand size of the U.S. budget deficit, \"although these will not\nbe in the forefront of the market early next week,\" Kahan said.\n    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding\nauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and\nThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results\nwith little excitement. However, a successful auction could\nprove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market\npsychology.\n Reuter",

    "title": "JUDGE HEARS APPEALS AGAINST MANVILLE <QMAN> PLAN",
    "content": "A federal judge heard arguments that\nManville Corp's chapter 11 reorganization plan, which was\nconfirmed in December, should be thrown out.\n    During a four-and-a-half hour hearing, U.S. District Judge\nWhitman Knapp heard arguments in five different appeals.\nWhitman took the issues under advisement and will rule at a\nlater date.\n    Key challenges were made by a group of Manville\nshareholders, who claim they were not adequately represented\nduring the bankruptcy proceedings and that a 2.5 billion dlr\nfund to pay victims of asbestos is overfunded.\n   \n    Another challenge came from a group of asbestos victims who\nclaimed the trust fund was underfunded.\n    Today, Manville lawyers said there have been about 54,000\nclaims filed by those injured by asbestos.\n    The reorganization plan also sets up a trust fund, with\ninitial funding of 125 mln dlrs, to pay for property damage\nclaims. Additional funds will be available if needed. Manville\nsaid there are currently 9,500 property damage claims filed.\n    Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 and its\nreorganization plan was approved by all parties except the\ncommon stockholders.\n   \n    The stockholders objected to the proposal because it would\ngreatly dilute the value of their holdings. The plan would have\nthe effect of converting every eight shares of common stock\ninto just one share.\n    Manville lawyers today criticized shareholder groups for\nfurther delaying the execution of the bankruptcy plan. Herbert\nEdelman, one of Manville's lawyers, pointed out that many\nthousands of victims and creditors were still awaiting payments\nand that many victims had already died.\n    He also pointed out that the bankruptcy court had found\nManville to be insolvent.\n    \"They (shareholders) want the plan put aside to get that\nnebulous value that may be down the road,\" Edelman said.\n    Common shareholders claim they were not adequately\nrepresented because U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland\nrefused requests to divide the equity holders committee into\ntwo separate groups, one repesenting common shareholders and\nthe other preferred stock shareholders.\n    During confirmation hearings of the plan, the equity\ncommittee's lawyer George Hahn walked out of the hearing,\nsaying he could not represent both groups.\n    The equity holders committee was then abolished.\n   \n    An unofficial committee representing 10 pct of the\ncompany's stock was present at the confirmation hearings.\nHowever, lawyers for that committee did not present evidence or\ncross examine witnesses.\n    During today's hearing Paul Gonson, a Washington lawyer\nrepresenting the Securities and Exchange Commission, told Judge\nKnapp that the agency was also concerned that the shareholders\ndid not have adequate representation.\n    Knapp said the unofficial committee was represented by the\nNew York law firm of Kronish, Lieb, Weiner and Hellman. \"They\nhave one of the best law firms in town,\" Knapp said.\n\n Reuter",

    "content": "Prospects for Tokyo stocks are mixed this\nweek with investors trying to figure out the future of the\nyen/dollar exchange rate and digest the implications of OPEC's\nlatest accord on crude output and pricing, brokers said.\n    They said the market should extend the dull trend it has\nbeen in since the 225-share index fell rapidly from the record\nclose at 25,929.42 on June 17.\n    It ended at 24,902.72 on Saturday and fell further this\nmorning to close at 24,707.68 in an uncertain reaction to the\nweaker yen and the weekend OPEC accord.\n    Brokers said attention could focus more on the cheaper,\nless well-known stocks in the exchange's first and second\nsections, which were generally showing more resilience. The\nsecond section index, in contrast to the first, closed at a\nrecord 2,404.64 on June 26, surpassing the peak set on June 17\nof 2,401.71.\n    \"Probably shares of companies involved in the domestic\neconomy are a good bet,\" said a broker at Daiwa Securities Co\nLtd. He said his observation was based on figures showing that\nbusiness activity in Japan is booming.\n    The government said on Friday that department store and\nsupermarket sales rose 7.5 pct in May from a year earlier,\nwhile orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms in\nthe same month were up 7.6 pct year on year. Brokers expected\nmore such figures, but said many stocks linked to domestic\ndemand remain overpriced.\n    \"They are hard to find, but companies with an attractive\nniche in the domestic economy, unaffected by currency\nmovements, are the best bet,\" said a broker at a foreign\nsecurities house who declined to be identified.\n    But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domestic\nconsumption are stirring inflation fears. The consumer price\nindex rose 0.2 pct in May from April, the third consecutive\nmonth on month increase.\n    Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation,\nwhich erodes the real value of stock holdings, they say rising\nprices arouse concern that interest rates may climb.\n    The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut\nin Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. Such assumptions have now\ndied, discouraging investors, brokers said.\n    If oil prices rise, the stock market in Japan could suffer\na downturn as higher production costs stir inflation.\n    But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may\nalso firm, brokers said. \"I have never been able to justify this\nbecause it should mean that the cost of importing rises,\" said a\nbroker at Yamaichi Securities Co. \"It just always happens.\"\n    Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally\nif the dollar climbs against the yen. But prices of many blue\nchip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks, making\nthem look less attractive, brokers said.\n    However, if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen, the\nmarket index may rally, brokers said. A lower dollar could damp\ndown rising capital outflows into dollar investments from\nJapan's stock and bond markets, brokers said.\n    And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the\nbalance of trade between the United States and Japan, a lower\ndollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand\nfor American imports by stimulating its local economy, brokers\nsaid.\n    \"If the dollar falls, buy domestic, if it rises, maybe buy a\nfew exporters,\" said one foreign broker.\n REUTER",

Published group risk\nprovisions rose to 865.9 mln marks from 366.7 mln. But the\nshare of credits to problem countries covered by risk\nprovisions was still below 50 pct at BfG, he said.\n    The BSV Bank stake sale was one of the main factors behind\na 3.8 billion mark drop in the group balance sheet in 1986.\n    Wegscheider said the re-organization of BfG, planned before\nthe AMB acquisition and involving a decentralization, would\noccupy much of BfG's energies this year. BfG and AMB were also\nlooking at ways of cooperating in sales of services.\n REUTER",

At present, the\npresident is chosen through an electoral college system which\nthe opposition says is stacked in favour of the DJP.\n    Among other major changes, the package offers a release of\nmost political prisoners, a guarantee of human rights and a\nfree press.\n    Kim Young-sam, head of the opposition Reunification\nDemocratic Party, said, \"I wholeheartedly welcome Chairman Roh's\nannouncement, though it was a belated measure.\"\n    A Western diplomat told Reuters \"It's a very substantial,\nvery courageous move.\"\n    The second surprise in Roh's proposals was an amnesty for\nleading dissident Kim Dae-jung, who has been banned from\npolitics because of a suspended sentence for sedition charges.\n    The only opposition demand which is not met by Roh's\npackage is the RDP's insistence that Chun should step down\nimmediately.\n REUTER",

Has ensured\nthere will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in\neffect putting pressure on end-users,\" a European crude oil\ntrader said.\n    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, \"There's no reason to expect\na weak market from now on.\"\n    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, \"We\nthought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter\nproduction so the market will react very bullishly.\"\n    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a\nslight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark\ncrude, they expect price increases over the next few days.\n    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at\naround 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still\nbelow the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.\n    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu\nDhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak\npositions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders\nsaid sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.\n    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to\nstabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.\n    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected\nand Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter\nrequirements before October.\n    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on\nEuropean and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.\n    \"There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production\nby the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,\" said an\ninternational trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less\nbullish, \"For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on\nhow much they (OPEC members) cheat.\"\n    A Singapore trade source said, \"There is enough cheating and\nleakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is\nno need to worry about shortages.\"\n    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,\nafter Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish\nfactor to be considered.\n    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as\npossible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market\ncooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.\n    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in\nthin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates\nquiet on minimal buying interest.\n    Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and\ntight prompt supplies, dealers said.\n REUTER",

(0401 GMT) after the network\nimposed a contract which the union said was unacceptable.\n    The union said its main objection to the contract was that\nit permitted NBC to employ additional part-time workers.\n    The average salary of workers represented by NABET is\n65,000 dlrs a year.\n    Union officials said management was being intransigent and\nblamed General Electric <GE>, which purchased NBC and its\nparent company RCA in 1985 in a flurry of communications\ncompany takeovers.\n    The strike is the first for NBC since 1976.\n    The two sides said they have set no time to meet again.\n REUTER",

    "content": "OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6\nmln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost\nspot prices and enable the group to raise its official\nreference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current\n18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.\n    \"Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the\nofficial price will be 20 dlrs in January,\" a Japanese refiner\nsaid.\n    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC\nmembers such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and\nQatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.\n    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as\nthe market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987\noutput. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs\nfor Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for\nU.K. Brent, traders said.\n    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into\nthe U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate\n(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.\n    \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import\nMideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those\ngrades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader.\n    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot\nmarket has further upward potential in the short term, having\nrisen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.\n    \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that\nbasis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said\none international oil trader in Tokyo.\n    \"But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought\nback up again pretty quickly,\" he added.\n    One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to\nexpect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to\nraise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.\n    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly\nin the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and\nthe likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to\nmaintain steady prices.\n    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day\ncompared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its\nexport capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline\nthrough Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.\n    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,\nagainst its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up\nto 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.\n    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating\non the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price\ndiscounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But\nthey mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as\nswing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher\noutput by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise\ntoo high too fast.\n    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln\nbarrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the\nstockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises\ntoo much,\" an oil industry analyst said.\n REUTER",

    "content": "The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's\nstate-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has\nretired at his own request, oil industry sources said.\n    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation\nplanning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.\n    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,\nleft in a major oil industry shake up last December.\n    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the\npost permanently.\n    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki\nYamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry\nsources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil\nmarket.\n    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20\nyears. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi\nArabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned\nto the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.\n    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an\nOPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel\nlast December.\n    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations\nwhich could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia\ndoes business, the sources said.\n    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's\njob include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who\nearlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of\nPetroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister\nFaisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the\nUniversity of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,\nAhmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic\nPort.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in\nplanned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15\nuntil the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle\ntold Reuters.\n    \"We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,\"\nhe said. \"The accord reached there means stability in the oil\nmarket and we shall continue making our contribution.\"\n    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would\nprobably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle\nsaid. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and\nwould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.\n    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of\n16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and\nretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord\nbased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.\n    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and\nit's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter\nceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth\nquarter.\n    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore\nfields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from\nplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained\nwithin its December accord on output and prices.\n    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around\n840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln\nbpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.\n    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since\nFebruary reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.\n    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for\na meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement\non the latest oil production cutbacks.\n    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC\nproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia\nand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep\nprices stable.\n    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an\nOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around\n18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.\n    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export\nearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price\nduring the first half of 1986.\n    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some\nstability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade\ndeficit.\n     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently\nrefused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to\nthe producing oil companies to set the levels of production.\n REUTER",

    "content": "The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen\nin certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements\ntoday to show its determination to maintain an easy money\npolicy, central bank officials said.\n    \"Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an\nannouncement effect, in which we would reassure the market of\nthe fact that we have not changed our policy stance,\" a senior\ncentral bank official told Reuters.\n    The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month\ncommercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the\ninterbank market today, the officials said.\n    The central bank was concerned about growing market\nexpectations of higher interest rates, which were in part\nresponsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,\nthe officials said.\n    But money traders said the market generally shrugged off\nthe bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far\nbelow prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month\nCDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid\nwas 3.75 pct, they said.\n    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact\nbecause it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.\n    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD\nbuying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's\npledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.\n    \"We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip\nany further,\" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing\nmarket expectation of higher rates will remain.\n    \"If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay\nabove four pct for the time being,\" he said.\n REUTER",

He declined to say\nhow soon parliament might be dissolved.\n    The Democrats, one of four parties in the ruling coalition,\nhave been split ever since winning 100 of the parliament's 347\nseats in elections in July 1986.\n    The current coalition was formed last August and\nconstitutes a hefty parliamentary majority. But the Democrats'\ninability to work well together or with their coalition\npartners has made the government vulnerable to the small but\nmore cohesive opposition.\n    Parliament closed the first of its two annual sessions this\nmonth and is scheduled to reconvene in September.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Zimbabwe's temporary freeze on salaries,\nwages and prices will give the economy a breather, but radical\neconomic reforms are needed to resuscitate business and attract\nforeign investment, economists said.\n    They said the June 24 freeze on government, state company\nand private sector wages until January 1988 has postponed,\nrather than provided, solutions to Zimbabwe's economic\nproblems.\n    They urged a review of the tax system, the introduction of\ninvestment incentives, a review of foreign exchange and price\ncontrols and a check on government expenditure.\n    These measures would aim to stimulate investment and create\nemployment for the 100,000 school leavers annually seeking\njobs.\n    The freeze, which Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero said\nwould check production costs and reduce the budget deficit, has\nbeen partly welcomed by business but criticised by workers\nwhose real purchasing power has been severely eroded since\n1980.\n    The government announced the freeze amid a worsening\neconomic crisis caused by serious drought, a budget deficit of\nmore than one billion Zimbabwean dlrs and an acute balance of\npayments problem owing to debt service costs, now 357 mln U.S.\nDlrs on an external debt of two billion U.S. Dlrs.\n    The crisis has forced the country to make companies halve\ndividend remittances to overseas shareholders.\n    The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce supported the\nfreeze on wages and salaries but criticised the promised\nstricter control of prices of goods and services.\n    \"If those companies whose costs of production increase are\nnot allowed a price increase, profit margins will again be\nseverely squeezed, and this would negate current government\nefforts to revitalise the economy,\" the chamber said.\n    The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said the freeze would\nworsen the plight of the lowest paid workers.\n    The union body has been campaigning for a minimum monthly\nwage of 277 Zimbabwean dlrs (165 U.S. Dlrs). The lowest paid\nnow earn about 100 dollars (60 U.S. Dlrs).\n    \"Inflation is hitting hardest those in the low income\nbracket which demands that any economic recovery programme\nshould be biased in their favour,\" the union body said.\n    It added that the promised price freeze was \"bolting the\nstable door when in fact the horse is gone\" because prices of\nmost basic commodities had already risen phenomenally.\n    Both unions and business hope that the freeze heralds a\nreturn to wage bargaining between workers and employers, rather\nthan government-regulated pay awards.\n    Zimbabwe has, since 1980, set annual minimum wages for\ndifferent sectors of the economy and awarded wage and salary\nincrements on a sliding scale which gave higher increases to\nthe lowest paid.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Banks in Singapore are planning to\nfurther expand their treasury, securities, equities and debt\ninstruments activities in line with global financial markets,\nbankers and economists told Reuters.\n    \"Banks are moving towards treasury activities because they\nsee them as a vital link in global capital and foreign exchange\nmarkets,\" Clemente Escano, vice-president of Union Bank of\nSwitzerland, said.\n    Central to that link is the Asian Dollar Market's pool of\nfunds, with deposits estimated at 212 billion dlrs in March.\n    Banks are fond of booking and tapping offshore Asian Dollar\nMarket funds here for a variety of reasons, including low\ntaxes.\n    New impetus has come to this market with growth of 52\nbillion dlrs in the year to March partly due to the\nliberalisation of financial markets in Japan leading to an\nincrease in interbank activity, bankers said.\n    Despite the slowdown in traditional loan syndications in\nthe region, the offshore market has continued to grow as banks\nrebundle and securitise their assets, creating new generations\nof tradeable debt instruments, bankers said.\n    Singapore's daily turnover in foreign exchange dealing has\nincreased to 30 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1987 against 21 billion\nlast year, according to Finance Minister Richard Hu.\n    Susumu Sakaguchi, manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said the\n22 Japanese banks in Singapore were expanding their foreign\nexchange departments, which accounted for at least 30 to 40 pct\nof total bank activities last year.\n    Sakaguchi said the liberalisation of the Toyko market\nstimulated Asian Dollar deposits and foreign exchange turnover\nand is leading to active Japanese futures trading on the\nSingapore International Monetary Exchange.\n    Robin Tomlin, managing director of Singapore International\nMerchant Bankers Ltd, said international merchant banks cluster\nin Singapore because of the tax incentives, presence of major\nplayers and shift in regional capital flows.\n    Tomlin pegged much of the future of the Singapore banking\nindustry to securities and equities.\n    \"In 1988 we should see an expansion of securities trading\nfollowing the link-up\" of the Stock Exchange of Singapore\nDealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ) with the London\nexchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers\nAutomated Quotation System (NASDAQ), he said.\n    Equity and equity-linked issues have dominated the\nfinancial markets here to date because of buoyant domestic and\ninternational stock markets. Tomlin said privatisation\nprogrammes, both in Singapore and abroad, would encourage huge\nflows of capital through the banks.\n    Applications received for the 30 mln Singapore Airline\nshares offered last week were worth 601.1 mln Singapore dlrs.\nThe share offer by Sembawang Maritime Ltd raked in a record 6.8\nbillion Singapore dlrs in May this year.\n    Bankers said Singapore's privatisations and links with\nexchanges abroad showed its determined international stance.\n    Singapore's four major local banks have been venturing into\nstockbroking, the new government securities market and SESDAQ,\ncompeting successfully for business with the merchant banks.\n    Tomlin said merchant banks will continue to play an\nimportant role in the Singapore domestic capital markets but\nthe modest size of the total market would limit the potential\nof new entrants.\n    Bankers said a total of 650 mln U.S. Dlrs was raised in the\nSingapore capital market last year and the volume of new issues\nwould to grow in 1987.\n    Total lending by banks in Singapore fell by 1.04 billion\ndlrs in March 1987 compared with last year following the trend\ntowards asset management services and other capital market\nactivities.\n    Hans-Rudolf Schaub, the senior vice-president and manager\nof Swiss Bank Corp, said his bank has chosen Singapore as its\nAsian treasury centre because of favourable tax rules for\noffshore banks, political stability and economic growth.\n    He said the bank might set up a securities portfolio\nmanagement service here in addition to its existing links in\ninternational money market services with Zurich and New York.\n REUTER",

Banks have since been closed\non Fridays, the Islamic weekend, and Saturdays.\n    The new regulation will require banks to work from 7.30\nA.M. To 12 noon from Saturday to Thursday inclusive. Banks may\nopen on these days during the afternoon between 3.30 and 5.30.\n    The regulations apply to bank opening hours, not to staff\nworking hours, which continue to be decided by banks.\n    Under the five day week introduced in early April, banks\nhave been obliged to open from 8 A.M.

Bond yields have dropped sharply,\nwhile land prices in Tokyo have soared.\n    The excessive speculation means the markets are\nincreasingly out of touch with economic reality and thus more\nvulnerable, one central bank source said.\n    A collapse now could rob businessmen and consumers of what\nlittle confidence they have in the economy after the\nyen-induced recession of the past year, private economists\nsaid.\n    Some hard-pressed exporters already make greater profits\nthrough financial dealings than from their basic businesses,\nthey said.\n    \"There seems to be an accelerated demand for money to\nsupport transactions in shares, bonds, land and other existing\nassets which has little bearing on value added and therefore on\nGNP,\" the Bank of Japan said in its report.\n    The increased inclination of investors to seek capital\ngains and the accompanying rise in prices of existing assets\ncould have dangerous implications for the economy, it added.\n    In the Bank's view, a major reason behind skyrocketing\nprices was its own easy monetary policy and the belief in the\nmarket that interest rates were heading inexorably lower.\n    Mindful of the potential inflationary dangers posed by\nexcessive liquidity, the Central Bank's board recently decided\nit had to spell out clearly to the markets that a further\ndiscount rate cut was not in the offing, one source said.\n    But the bank had to do that without tightening monetary\npolicy and running the risk of a market collapse.\n    This was achieved partly by a rise in short-term interest\nrates, which Bank sources ascribed to seasonal pressures and to\na change in market expectations.\n    While denying the bank was tightening monetary policy, a\nsenior source welcomed the change in market expectations.\n    The source acknowledged the shift may have been caused\npartly by the decision to press commercial banks to limit\nlending in the July/September period. Faster than expected\neconomic growth and a strong dollar also played a part.\n    In the longer run, the Central Bank is counting on a\ngradual upturn in the economy to draw liquidity from the\nfinancial markets into productive areas like capital spending,\none Bank of Japan economist said.\n    But while it waits for that to occur over the next six\nmonths, it may have to avoid any overt tightening of monetary\npolicy that could collapse the market and lead to recession.\n REUTER",

The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain\nlevels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.\n    \"They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal\nwhenever they think necessary,\" a senior dealer at an Oslo bank,\nwho declined to be identified, told Reuters.\n    The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket\n-- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is\ncommitted to defending.\n    A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.\nThe limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.\n    The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest\nrates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better\nthan expected economic indicators which showed a sharply\nreduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising\naround the current annual rate of 10 pct.\n REUTER",

    "title": "HIGHER REVENUES DEAL BLOW TO JAPAN TAX REFORM PLAN",
    "content": "Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's\ndiminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt\na serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax\nrevenues in 1986/87, government officials said.\n    Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to\nprovide the revenue for more than 1,000 billion yen of tax cuts\npromised in the government's emergency economic package last\nmonth. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the\n1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more than\nexpected.\n    That means the government should have more than enough\nmoney in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the\nplanned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax\nmeasures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.\n    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the\nabolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising\nrevenue to offset the tax cuts.\n    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of\nan indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes to\ngain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on\nsmall savings.\n    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed\nfrom increased receipts from land and securities taxes, as\nprices of both shares and land soared, one official said.\n    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than\nexpected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last year\ninduced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.\n    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be\nreleased by the Finance Ministry on July 1.\n    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut\nattempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce\ninvestment spending by government departments in the 1988/89\nbudget, several officials said.\n    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to\nstick with its so-called \"minus-ceiling\" policy, which calls for\ngovernment departments to reduce investment spending by five\npct a year.\n    But he acknowledged this would be difficult, given the\nsharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic\nand U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Share analysts and commentators say\nVolkswagen AG <VOWG.F> has suffered an enormous loss of face\nfrom which it could take time to recover over its 473 mln mark\ncurrency swindle.\n    An auditors' report on the affair, prepared in time for\nthis week's annual shareholders' meeting, largely cleared the\nmanagement of Volkswagen of blame.\n    But \"mud sticks,\" said Gavin Launder, an analyst with\nScrimgeour Vickers in London.\n    (See index on ECRA)\n    The financial daily, Boersenzeitung, wrote in a commentary:\n\"More devastating than the losses linked to the currency scandal\nis the resulting loss of image for the company.\"\n    VW had to make provisions of 473 mln marks to cover losses\nfrom unauthorised foreign exchange deals which the auditors,\nDeutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft, said highlighted major gaps in\nthe supervisory apparatus of the firm's financial department.\n    The auditors' report highlighted failings in VW's\ncontrolling system, especially in relation to a 385 mln mark\ndeal with the Hungarian National Bank, but shed little light on\nwhy they were made. \n    It said the contracts did not benefit VW and were only\nadvantageous to its banks. It did not detail how the foreign\nexchange dealers may have profitted.\n    It concluded: \"The nature, scope and technical construction\nof the deals ... Suggest a targeted and professionally executed\nmanipulation to the detriment of VW.\"\n    The head of the finance department, Rolf Selowsky, resigned\ndays after the scandal broke in March. He is not accused of any\nwrongdoing, but auditors concluded he had \"not applied the\nnecessary diligence in all instances.\"\n    Two former VW foreign exchange dealers have been arrested.\n    But even VW admits that the report, published last week,\nrevealed important company failings.\n    Peter Frerk, who has temporarily taken over Selowsky's\nreponsibilities, said the findings were \"not a first class\nacquittal.\" The currency swindle was a \"lamentable event for our\ncompany,\" he told journalists.\n    The auditors said the remaining members of VW's management\nboard and supervisory board had correctly fulfilled their\nobligations, a verdict which almost certainly means that major\nWest German banks, who vote on behalf of large numbers of\nshareholders, will ratify both boards at the July 2 meeting.\n    Many market analysts, especially in London, do not believe\na sharp rise in VW's share price last week reflects a major\nreassessment of the firm on the basis of the auditors' report.\n    The stock closed at 430 marks on Friday, up 11 pct from a\nweek earlier. Dealers referrred to short-term bargain-hunting,\nand one London broker said \"I'm not sure it's much of a bargain.\"\nMost brokers said they would not recommend clients to buy at\nthese levels.\n    Analysts believe VW will do well to match its 1986 group\nnet profit of 582 mln marks this year, and one broker in London\nsaid the company would be lucky to report profits only 15 pct\ndown.\n    VW is expected to fare very well both in its home market\nand in Europe. But sales have fallen sharply in the U.S and\nBrazil, where the latest price freeze could exacerbate results\neven further.\n    The company hopes to benefit in the long term from its\ntakeover of the Spanish company SEAT, but this subsidiary is\nstill producing losses.\n    VW has also just announced a deal to build light pick-up\ntrucks with Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T> at an under-utilised\nplant in Hanover, but analysts noted production here was only\nexpected to take off fully in 1990.\n REUTER",

    "content": "Canada has threatened to stop imports\nof Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary\ninspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish\nagriculture ministry official told Reuters.\n    The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the\nrequest of the European Commission, which Denmark approached\nfor support.\n    Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an\ninterview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: \"Denmark will not\naccept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach\nan understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.\"\n    Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns\nin 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community\ntotalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.\n    Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion\nthat the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC\nveterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.\n    But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said\nthe inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC\nregulations. \"Canadian officials are very concerned about the\ntrade implications. We are holding active discussions with the\nEC and bilaterally,\" she added.\n REUTER",

In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter\nlevel of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter\ntarget.\n    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, \"OPEC third\nquarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while\nfourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd\"\n    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production\nlevels would have on prices.\n    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,\nrising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to\nadhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln\nbarrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia\nand Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when\na 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about\nSeptember.\n    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War\nenemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369\nmln in the second half.\n    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from\nthe Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has\nbeen supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. \"We will\nnot discuss it. There will not be any change,\" he said.\n    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended\nSaturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems\nto be adressed. \"We are overdoing it in holding too short a\nmeeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,\" he said.\n    Ali said the problem of price differentials between the\nprices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly\nat the meeting.\n\n    Ali said \"The problem of differentials is a real one. I\nwould hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem\nhas not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced\nrelative to heavy crudes.\"\n    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the\nnext OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said\n\"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do\nthe work of another minister.\"\n    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.\n    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread\nof 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.\n       \n Reuter",

    "content": "Ivory Coast rainfall this season has\nbeen less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee\nproduction has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily\nFraternite Matin reported.\n    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry\nconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.\nTrade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if\nthere is good rainfall in coming weeks.\n    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest\nin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has\nespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin\nsaid.\n    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this\nmonth 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,\ncompared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.\n    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture\nhad been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not\nneed very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have\nbeen affected in some regions, it added.\n    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast\n1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,\nwhich compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described\nearly development of the new main crop as patchy.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year\nforecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast\ndue to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated\nthe crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's\n4.33 mln bag harvest.\n    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee\ncrop as \"normal.\"\n REUTER",

    "title": "INTERNATIONAL SPOT OIL PRICES FIRM ON OPEC ACCORD",
    "content": "OPEC's weekend decision to cut planned\noil output levels for second half 1987 has renewed market\nconfidence in the oil price outlook for the rest of the year\nand boosted international spot prices, oil traders said.\n    Spot crude prices are now standing 80-85 cents a barrel\nhigher than at the start of the OPEC meeting last Thursday and\ncould continue their rise in the next few weeks, they said.\n    The new optimism springs from the agreement reached by OPEC\nministers in Vienna on Saturday to fix a July-December output\nceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd).\n    At its previous meeting in December, OPEC set a provisional\n16.6 mln bpd output limit for the third quarter but proposed a\nsharp rise to 18.3 mln in the fourth. The ceilings were to back\nup its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC was\ncontemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling, spot\nprices of the most widely traded crude oil, Britain's Brent\nBlend, surged 30-40 cents a barrel.\n    Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally this\nmorning in London, taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35\ndlrs, compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week.\n    Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishly\nto news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplies\nlater in the year, when demand for oil increases with the onset\nof the Northern Hemisphere winter, and further rises in spot\nprices.\n    \"There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourth\nquarters of this year\" one trader said. \"In the past three months\nwe have already seen a rise in demand, particularly from the\nU.S., And I expect to see even higher prices\" he added.\n    Mehdi Varzi, analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson\nin London, agreed.\n    Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautious\nin setting the new output ceilings. \"There is now a great chance\nthat Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the next\nmonth,\" he said.\n    Laurie Law, analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York,\nsaid over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West Texas\nIntermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of the\nyear from just over 20 dlrs now.\n    WTI, the U.S. Benchmark crude, usually fetches a premium of\n80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year, spot Brent\nhas held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel.\n    But some traders, fearing continued over-production by some\nOPEC members, sounded a note of caution over the new accord.\n    Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreement\nbecause other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demand\nfor the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq.\n    In recent months Iraq has been producing 500,000 bpd above\nits assigned quota, and it could begin pumping a further\n500,000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream in\nSeptember.\n    According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa\nal-Sabah, actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could be\nwell above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd.\n REUTER",

    "title": "TECHNOLOGY/ALTERNATIVES TO IBM SOFTWARE STANDARD",
    "content": "In the fast paced personal computer\nindustry, millions can be made in six months, and such an\nopportunity may exist now for companies seeking to capitalize\non the delay of a new IBM software standard.\n    When International Business Machines Corp <IBM> announced\nits new generation of personal computers, the PS/2 family, in\nApril, it also decided to establish a new operating system for\nthe machines, a death sentence for the billions of dollars of\nsoftware now in use on the existing system.\n    Because IBM is the world's largest computer company - some\n70 pct of the world's computers bear the IBM logo - most\nindustry analysts, and even IBM's competitors, expect that\nwithin two years the new operating system, called OS/2, will be\nas commonplace as the current standard, MS-DOS, is now.\n    \"By 1989, at least one half to 60 pct of all personal\ncomputers will be sold with OS/2,\" predicted George Colony,\npresident of the consulting firm Forrester Research Inc.\n    But until then there is an opportunity, some analysts said,\nfor firms selling advanced versions of MS-DOS, specialised\nmulti-tasking software packages and Unix, an alternative to\nMS-DOS developed by American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T>\nthat has developed a following among engineers and the federal\ngovernment.\n    OS-2, which IBM is developing with Microsoft Corp, the\nauthor of MS-DOS, will not be ready for another six months. IBM\nsaid last week that the product is on schedule but analysts and\nother software developers are skeptical, since delays in major\nnew software products are commonplace.\n    Initial acceptance of the new system will most likely be\nhindered by the disgruntlement of hardware and software vendors\nalike, who would prefer to keep making products that work with\ntried and true MS-DOS, according to Paul Cubbage, software\nanalyst with the market research firm Dataquest Inc.\n    Compaq, IBM's major personal computer competitor, has\nalready said it will stick with the MS-DOS standard. Compaq\npresident Rod Canion said recently their will be no \"automatic\nmass migration\" to OS/2. \"(Advanced MS-DOS) applications will\ncontinue to meet a far broader set of users needs than OS/2\nwill supply long after it becomes available,\" he said.\n    Cubbage acknowledged that \"it will probably be a year or\nmore before any really useful applications are available for\nOS-2,\" creating opportunities for multi-tasking programs. \"But\nthere comes a time when the memory limits of those gets to\nyou,\" he said.\n    IBM's new operating system was as big an event to the\ncomputer industry as the PS-2 announcement itself. The new\ncomputers, the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp's\nfast 80386 microprocessor, are expected to rejuvenate the\nsagging sales of the personal computer industry and already\ngave a big boost to IBM.\n    Company officials said last week that 250,000 PS/2s were\nshipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBM\nexpect record pc sales ths year as a result.\n    The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking since\nthe full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tapped\nuntil a new operating system or other high level software is\navailable, analysts said.\n    OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs,\nor tasks, at once on a personal computer, ideally without any\nslowdown in operation, a capability the industry has long\nstrived for.\n    Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2, in\nparticular an advanced version of its Windows multitasking\nprogram, which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS.\n    Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advanced\nversion of the program, Windows 386, will be announced in\nSeptember and available six to eight weeks later, at a price of\n100 dlrs and 300 dlrs. OS/2 is expected to cost 325 dlrs.\n\n    Some software developers have said the the program,\ndesigned for 80386-based personal computers, may even be\nsuperior to OS/2 in allowing users to multitask applications\nwithout disruption.\n     But several analysts commented that what users really want\nis a multi-taksing operating system for 80386-based personal\ncomputers, and so far that desire has been met primarily by a\nsmall Atlanta software publisher, The Software Link Inc. In\nlate spring the company announced PC-MOS/386, a multi-tasking,\nmultiuser operating system that is compatible with MS/DOS and\nworks on 80386-based computers.\n    The company said it filled 2,500 orders in the first four\nweeks of availability and expects shipments to reach 40,000 by\nyear end.\n    International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unix\ncould be the most promising alternative to OS/2, even once the\nIVM system is available.\n    IBM did not endorse Unix for any of its PS/2 models,\nalthough it did say that it would announce a version of its\nAdvanced Interactive Executive (AIX), a Unix compatible\noperating system.\n    But the federal government requires Unix compatability for\nmost of its computer contracts, it is almost certain that other\ncompanies will provide Unix-style operating systems for the IBM\nsystems.\n    ATT itself two weeks ago introduced a version of Unix that\nis compatible with the 80386 microprocessor, although not IBM's\ncomputer specifically.\n    Analysts saw the announcement as a move to get Unix\naccepted as a strong alternative to OS/2 before the IBM system\nhas a chance to take off.\n Reuter",

The company has financed a portion of\nits debt service and other obligations through sales of assets\nand has relied on short-term waivers from its lenders to\nprevent defaults on principal and interest payments.\n    Because of Allis-Chalmers' financial position, it said, new\nfinancing facilities were not available outside of Chapter 11,\nadding substantially all U.S. assets other than inventory are\npledged as security for its debts.\n Reuter",

    "content": "Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov\ndescribed the Soviet Union's economic management system as\nobsolete and called on the Supreme Soviet, the nominal\nparliament, to adopt a draft law on major economic reform.\n    In a speech to the 1,500 member body, Ryzhkov said\nexcessive central control by Moscow-based ministries and\nwasteful use of resources had led to a situation where 13 pct\nof Soviet industrial enterprises were making a loss in 1986.\n    He said the public faced acute food and housing problems\nand a \"shadow economy\" was growing because the state could not\nmeet demand.\n    He added that the USSR had failed to keep up with the\ntechnology revolution.\n    \"The methods of the past system of economic management have\nbecome obsolete,\" Ryzhkov declared. \"The need for change is\nevident and urgent.\"\n    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who set the tone last\nweek with a frank speech on the economy, was present during the\nspeech.\n    The legislation outlined by Ryzhkov, formally called the\ndraft law on state enterprises, is expected to be approved by\nthe Supreme Soviet, to take effect next January 1.\n    Under the law, all enterprises are to become financially\nself-supporting by taking charge of income and outlay, with\nwages tied to profit in order to increase worker incentive.\n    Firms will compete for orders from the state, which are due\nto decline as direct contracts between enterprises expand.\n    Ryzhkov said the state planning agency, Gosplan, would be\nrestructured to set national economic priorities instead of\nadministering factories directly through five year plans.\n    \"We need a fundamentally new approach to yearly planning,\" he\nadded, saying annual central plans would be abandoned from 1991\nand enterprises charged with developing their own plans.\n\n    He said scientific research should be integrated closely\nwith industry to make up a technology gap with the West and\nenterprises should use market research to meet consumer demand.\n    Ryzhkov blamed the state supply body, Gossnab, for allowing\nshortages to occur. He said Gossnab was hoarding 27 billion\nroubles worth of raw materials and semi-finished products of\nenterprises. He said Gossnab should help expand wholesale\ntrade.\n    Ryzhkov said improved economic management of consumer goods\nand services was required to stem increasing speculation and\nthe growth of the black market economy. He called for a 10 fold\nincrease in the number of cooperatives to help in this field.\n    He said the price system needed radical revision to\naccurately reflect supply and demand, with the state setting\nprices only for \"products of national importance\" in changes to\nbe fully in place by the next five year plan beginning in 1991.\n    The practice of using credit to cover losses must also\nstop. Outstanding debts to the state had reached 40 billion\nroubles.\n    He said there were proposals to replace the \"cumbersome\"\nbanking system with six new banks -- a state bank and banks for\nforeign economic relations, agro-industry, construction,\nhousing and commercial services, and credit.\n    Ryzhkov said guarantees should be built into the law to\nprevent \"the distortion of the rights of enterprises.\" But\nnon-profitable enterprises would be declared bankrupt if\nefforts to make them self-supporting failed.\n    Bemoaning the \"economic illiteracy\" of many managers, he\ncalled for the retraining of economic personnel.\n    Ryzhkov said an immense amount of work lay ahead and \"doing\nit on the go\" would be difficult, but added, \"We do not have time\nto stop and ponder.\"\n    He said the changes should \"give a new image to socialism.\"\n REUTER",

    "content": "West Germany's foreign trade and current\naccount surpluses are expected to decline only slightly in 1987\nfrom their record levels last year, economists said.\n    Figures released by the Federal Statistics Office in\nWiesbaden showed that in the first five months of the year the\ntrade surplus grew 15.7 pct compared with the same 1986 period\nto 47.2 billion marks. The current account surplus rose 9.8 pct\nto 33.7 billion marks.\n    West Germany reported a 1986 current account surplus of 77\nbillion marks and a trade surplus of 113 billion marks.\n    Economists had expected the rise of the mark from year-ago\nlevels to have started biting more strongly into the nominal\nsurpluses.\n    The real surpluses are already declining. The Statistics\nOffice said after cheaper import prices were taken into\nconsideration, West Germany's imports by volume rose by more\nthan three pct in the first five months.\n    Exports had risen by only about one pct in real terms. The\ngovernment has pointed to this stronger real rise in imports\nthan exports when rejecting international pressure to boost\ndomestic consumption.\n    The Statistics Office said West Germany's trade surplus had\nrisen in May to 10.6 billion marks, from 8.9 billion in April\nand 8.1 billion in May last year.\n    The current account surplus had risen to 7.5 billion marks\nin May from 6.1 billion in April and 6.3 billion marks a year\nearlier.\n    Exports rose strongly from the year-ago month by 6.6 pct to\n43.31 billion marks, while May imports of 32.76 billion marks\nhad risen only 0.8 pct in the year.\n    The Ifo economic research institute in Munich said in a\nstudy published today that the trade surplus would probably\nonly fall to around 101 billion marks this year, compared with\nthe 113 billion mark 1986 record.\n    It predicted a fall in the current account surplus to 61\nbillion marks from 77 billion.\n    Ifo said this reduction would only be \"a small step on the\nway to reducing imbalances in the world economy.\"\n    Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank AG, predicted\na 1987 trade surplus of 100 billion marks. He saw a slightly\nhigher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billion\nmarks.\n    Helmut Henschel, with Westdeutsche Landesbank, put the 1987\ntrade surplus at 95 billion marks and the current account\nsurplus at 60 billion marks.\n    He said the strong rise in exports in May from the year-ago\nperiod was surprising but it probably reflected calendar\nfactors.\n REUTER",

    "content": "President Reagan is willing\nto compromise with Democrats in Congress on a plan to raise new\nfederal revenues next year if they back his plan to reform the\nbudget process, White House Budget Chief James Miller said.\n    \"If the Democrats want to insist that the president say\nwhatever is agreed to is a tax increase, then they'd better\njust forget it because he's not going to do that,\" Miller said\nin an interview with Reuters.\n    \"But there are a lot of revenues other than those the\npresident proposed (in his January budget plan), I think, that\nwe might look seriously at,\" he added.\n    The Reagan budget, which has been widely criticized by both\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress, envisages raising 22\nbillion dlrs in new revenues through the sale of a package of\ngovernment assets and new fees on certain federal services.\n    President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any tax\nincrease voted by Congress for the 1988 financial year, arguing\nthat cutting domestic spending was a better way to reduce the\nhuge federal deficit.\n    The deficit, which totaled 221 billion dlrs last year, is\nexpected to decline to about 175 billion dlrs this year and\nwould fall to about 140 billion dlrs next year under a budget\nblueprint recently approved by Congress.\n    The one trillion dlr congressional budget plan contains\nabout 19 billion dlr in additional revenues from new taxes in\nthe government's budgetary year beginning October 1.\n    The plan does not say how the additional revenues are to be\nraised, leaving it to the House Ways and Means and Senate\nFinance committees to fill in the details later this year.\n    Miller appeared to be signaling that the president might\nconsider some sort of tax increase despite his frequently\nstated rejection of the concept.\n    However, Miller declined to say which new revenue sources\nmight be acceptable to the president.\n    \"I think it would be counterproductive for me to (set out\noptions) which might suggest that we have one thing or another\nin mind,\" the White House budget chief said.\n    He cautioned Congress about the political repercussions of\ncertain moves, such as raising excise taxes on beer, cigarettes\nor telephone service, or raising corporate or personal income\ntax rates.\n    \"I think that those in Congress who think it will be a\nsimple matter to go along with some increase in excise taxes\nare underestimating what they would be getting themselves into,\"\nhe said. \"What they don't really realize is that the political\nopposition they are going to feel to excise taxes is going to\nbe a lot hotter tahn the political opposition to user fees, in\ncertain ways, or asset sales,\" he continued.\n    \"But there are a lot of other things and revenue issues in\ngovernment that probably ought to be addressed,\" he said.\n    Before agreeing to a revenue package, the president would\ninsist on reform of the budget process, Miller said.\n    \"The president is not going to take a sucker punch. He's not\ngoing to sit down and try to negotiate out a budget when we\ncan't be sure that whatever the president agrees to in fact\nwill be delivered,\" he emphasized.\n    \"We'd like to have a budget process that gives us a\ncontract, so that if the president agrees to something, he can\ndepend on its coming through.\"\n    After returning to the United States from the economic\nsummit in Venice earlier this month, President Reagan revived\nan earlier unsuccessful campaign for budget reform, calling for\na constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and the\npower -- called a \"line-item veto\" -- to block individual items\nin congressional spending bills.\n    At the Venice summit, U.S. trading partners called on\nWashington to cut its budget deficit to help reduce global\ntrade imbalances.\n   \n    Miller told an Italian journalist here yesterday that U.S.\ntrading partners \"have to have faith and trust in the ability of\nthe United tates to deal with its problems.\"\n    He said a deficit cut of about 40 to 45 billion dlrs a year\n\"is about the optimal rate of reduction in the deficit. I don't\nthink we can end the deficit overnight... I think we've got to\nhave a gradual reduction over a period of several years.\" \nMiller is in Beaver Creek attending the sixth annual World\nForum, a gathering of current and former government officials\nand business representatives discussing world economic and\npolitical issues.\n Reuter",

    "content": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,\nannounced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use\nforeign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual\nexport earnings for export promotion abroad.\n    The move is designed by the government to improve India's\ntrade deficit.\n    Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit\nScheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various\ntextiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and\nelectronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports\ngoods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.\n    The scheme replaces current rules which allow different\namounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a\nminimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.\n    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will\nqualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional\nspending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value\nof annual export earnings.\n    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and\nsemi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,\npsyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.\n    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the\ntwo groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their\nfreight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.\n    Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably\nhigher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because\nholders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to\nRBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.\n Reuter",

    "content": "U.S. moves to increase its warships in\nand around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on\nunprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a\ndirect military clash with Iran, diplomats said.\n    They said the American decision inevitably carries some\nrisk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt\nrhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.\n    \"As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the\nGulf could do serious damage,\" said one western diplomat.\n    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks\non \"soft targets\" such as merchant shipping not protected by\nAmerican or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.\n    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil\ntankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated\nby diplomats as low. However, \"There is the threat that the\nIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,\nwill go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said.\n    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar\nHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was\n\"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\"\n    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10\nwarships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to\npatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.\n    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting\nKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered\nto fly the American flag to give them naval protection.\n    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by\nIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.\n    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by\nChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is\npreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.\n    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to\nmake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.\n    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a\nlaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the\nFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.\n    \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti\nterritory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving\nworld opinion against Iran, remarked one.\n    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying\nout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.\n    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted\nlast Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event\nof any U.S. strike against Iran.\n    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused\nof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable\ncapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.\n    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that\nmost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to\npro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential\ntrouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.\n    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or\nother action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.\n Reuter",

    "content": "Brazil's motor industry, facing the\nworst crisis of its history, today sent thousands of workers on\ncollective leave because of a sharp drop in demand.\n    Company spokesmen said Autolatina, which last Friday laid\noff 4,000 workers, sent nearly 9,000 of its 56,500 employees in\nBrazil on collective leave until July 12.\n    General Motors do Brasil said it would give 10 days' leave\nto part of its 22,000 workforce from Wednesday.\n    Fiat is giving 2,000 workers a month's holiday from July 6.\n    Jacy Mendonca, industrial relations director of Autolatina,\na merger of Volkswagen and Ford in Brazil and Argentina, said\nlast week this would be the worst year ever for Brazil's auto\nindustry.\n    He forecast that 1987 would be worse than 1981, when\ndomestic sales dropped 40 pct to 580,000 units.\n    \"This year we'll be lucky if we can sell 550,000 units,\" he\nsaid.\n    Since Friday there have been two positive developments for\nthe industry. The government announced that it was scrapping a\n15 pct surcharge on all new car sales.\n    The surcharge, created in July last year, was originally\nset at 30 pct to help curb a car-buying boom and was in theory\nrefundable.\n    Brazilian car distributors, which since June 16 had halted\nall car purchases in protest against high government taxes,\nresponded to the government move by resuming purchases.\n    But industry spokesmen said taxes on vehicles were still\nhigh, 108 pct, and the sector still faced major problems.\n Reuter",

    "content": "The Securities and Exchange\nCommission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly\ndisclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a\ntakeover attempt by Campeau Corp.\n    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its\nlegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the\nagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping\ncenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's\ntakeover offer.\n    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs\non Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.\n    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had\nurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a\nshare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping\ncenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said.\n    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads\nthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of\nSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC\nfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in\nsales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.\n    Securities law requires takeover target companies to\npromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.\n    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct\nof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a\nshare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed\nby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at\nthwarting Campeau, the SEC said.\n    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an\namended SEC filing, the agency charged.\n    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was\nmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct\n3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint\nsaid.\n    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for\ncontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October\nwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or\n48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes\nafter it dropped its hostile tender offer.\n    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal\njudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in\nAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.\n    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining\nwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal\ntender offer.\n    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was\ndropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.\n    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,\nthe SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply\nwith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.\n    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it\nbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and\nquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.\n Reuter",

    "title": "CANADA SETS OFF ITS OWN BIG BANG",
    "content": "stock\nmarket deregulation -- will be heard Tuesday when the Canadian\nsecurities industry sets off its own fireworks.\n    Some companies are quickly taking advantage of\nderegulation, but more significant moves are likely to be a\nyear or more down the road, analysts say.\n    They say most foreign firms will focus at first on bond\ntrading, debt financing and underwriting, areas in which they\nhave experience under the old rules that allowed them to\nprovide government debt financing and advisory services.\n    \"When they learn about Canada, they might go into retail,\"\nsaid Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada. \"Then they will eventually\njust start to buy up the little guys. If the bigger boys' price\ncomes down, they'll end up taking those ones over too.\"\n    Under the new rules, barriers that kept banks, brokerage\nhouses, insurance companies and trust firms out of each others'\nbusinesses will be swept away in favor of wide-open\ncompetition.\n    The deregulation, sometimes nicknamed \"Little Bang,\" will\nallow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutions\nto set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages.\n    Foreign companies will also be able to form their own\nsecurities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of a\nCanadian firm. A year from now they can raise that stake to 100\npct. Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currently\nown no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage.\n    Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout by\nJune 30, involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts by\nforeign and domestic financial giants.\n    So far few deals have become reality, however, despite a\nswirl of rumors and merger talks. In the heat of deregulation\nfever, many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up to\nfour times book value, scaring off prospective suitors,\nanalysts said.\n    \"I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lower\ntheir asking prices,\" said financial services analyst Jeff\nCarney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., which recently terminated\ntalks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd.\n    \"I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynch\naway from Burns Fry,\" added Carney. \"It is just a lot of money.\nWhen your asset walks out the door every night, it is difficult\nto pay that amount of cash.\"\n    Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts was\nuncertainty about the final deregulation rules, which were\nissued and approved only in mid-June.\n    Most major foreign and Canadian financial players have\nfocused their deregulation strategy on planning their own\nCanadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto Stock\nExchange, Canada's largest equities market.\n    Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co.\nLtd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.\nrecently bought seats on Toronto's exchange, while United\nStates investment banks such as Salomon Inc. and Goldman, Sachs\nand Co. have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries.\n    The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firms\ninclude agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\nto raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd. to 30 pct from 10\npct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co. to acquire a\nminority interest in Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd.\n    Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreign\nacquisitions is likely a year away, when the newcomers become\nfamiliar with Canada.\n    Canadian firms will need such international alliances to\ncompete in the increasingly global securities market, industry\nofficials said.\n    \"That is one of the hopes of the regulators, that the change\nwill throw off one or two Canadian global firms,\" Toronto Stock\nExchange president Pearce Bunting told Reuters recently.\n    Canada's six major banks are also expected to proceed\ncautiously into the securities field.\n    Analysts said the brokers are too expensive now while the\nbanks are coping with Brazilian loan problems. Banks will also\nfind it tough to merge their cautious, bureaucratic culture\nwith that of leaner, more free-wheeling securities dealers,\nthey said.\n    While the banks have been approached by securities firms\nseeking merger partners, they have not yet bought into\nbrokerages, choosing to build securities units from within.\n    Last week, Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest\nbank, ended merger talks with Canadian broker Wood Gundy Inc.\nafter several months of negotiations.\n    But analyst Thompson forecast that if one bank finally\nacquires an existing firm, \"all the other banks will jump in.\n    \"They don't want to be perceived as missing out on\nsomething,\" said Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. analyst\nAlbert Thompson, who believes that brokerages are too expensive\na risk for banks.\n Reuter",

    "content": "Corporate mergers and acquisitions\nin and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had\nonly a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a\nleading business-backed organization said.\n    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business\nfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a\nnine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered\nsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding\ncommunities had not.\n    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left\ndue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but\nanother 21 firms were added to the list.\n    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.\nDuring the period, only six located in the city achieved\nFortune 500 status.\n    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of\nMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study\ngrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously\nhurt the economic climate of northern California.\n    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been\nlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were\ncreated during the period.\n    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater\nrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest\nof the United States and California.\n    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and\nchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news\nconference that the region had difficulties in persuading\ncompanies to locate there because of a fragmented local\npolitical system.\n    But he said that because of the amenities of living in San\nFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other\nmetropolitan area.\n    \"It's a great place to run a business,\" he added, \"but it's\na hell of a place to do business with government.\"\n    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf\nOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the\nrestructuring activity.\n    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period\nwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &\nCooke and Rolm.\n    Companies that grew enough during the period to make the\nFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,\nMcKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.\n    The study by the management consulting firm said that,\npartly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth\nin San Francisco has slowed since 1980.\n    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership\nhad adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and\ncharitable activities.\n Reuter",

They said that without further\nresearch and drilling in the area this summer, they would not\ndisclose any reserve figures.\n    Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial\nand developed, there would be a ready local market for the\nheavy crude it produced.\n    \"Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and\nthe price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a\nlot narrower today,\" Osborne said.\n    Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which\ninclude British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons\n(UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int.

Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and\nrice along with the state corporations.\n    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make\nhigh quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and\nto enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This\nwould help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.\n Reuter",

    "content": "U.S. firms are expected to enjoy the\nadvantage of superior experience over their Japanese\ncompetitors in the new, promising business of bringing asset\nrich Japanese investors to the U.S. financial futures markets.\n    Japan allowed local financial institutions last month to\nstart using overseas futures in currencies, bonds and stocks to\nhelp them manage their bulging foreign portfolios.\n    \"U.S. investment banks are going to take advantage. We've\nbeen in the business for two decades, the Japanese have not,\"\nsaid Eugene Atkinson, president of Goldman, Sachs Japan Corp.\n   \n    Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into the\nnew markets, but in fact participation so far has been slow,\nJapanese securities and bank sources in New York said.\n    Koichi Kane, Executive Vice President of Nomura Securities\nInternational, said, \"They're still in a starting up period.\"\n    \"They're testing the water,\" Atkinson added. But once they\nstart, the Japanese are likely to become very big players,\nopening up lucrative business opportunities, he said.\n    U.S. investment banking sources said the slow start is\nunderstandable because U.S. institutional investors, too, are\nfairly new to the market.\n   \n    Futures markets have a long history in the U.S., but\nbecause of the high risks involved American pension funds and\nmutual funds were not allowed to use the markets until\nrelatively recently, a U.S. investment bank futures analyst\nsaid.\n    In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures,\nan insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamed\nfor the slow start, the Japanese sources said.\n   \n    Japan is liberalizing its financial markets, but domestic\nfinancial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokers\nin Japan for overseas futures markets.\n    This may change next year, when bankers speculate that\nsecurities houses will be permitted to enter this line of\nbusiness.\n    While the Japanese are out of the business, the Americans\nhave moved in, with First Boston Corp, Salomon Brothers Inc,\nGoldman, Sachs and Co, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc and\nPainWebber Inc leading the charge, they said.\n   \n    In the U.S., Nikko Securities Co International Inc is\npreparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad of\nTrade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand for\nfutures products, Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said.\n    Nomura, Japan's largest securities house, has not yet\ndecided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in the\nU.S. to establish closer links between Japanese investors and\nthe U.S. futures markets, Kane said.\n    The evening session of CBT, inaugurated recently to\ncoincide with early Tokyo business hours, has increased\nJapanese participation to some extent, but the brokerage issue\nis still a hurdle, the Japanese sources said.\n   \n    High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futures\nmarket, so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytime\ntrading session in Chicago if possible, they said.\n    The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers and\nestablishing channels to pay fees and margins, but harmonizing\nclerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo and\nChicago are proving to be a burden, the sources said.\n    Some Japanese banks, which are largely barred from the\nsecurities industry in Japan, have contemplated buying into the\nU.S. brokerage business, the Japanese sources said.\n    \n    One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions,\nwhich was also a spur for U.S. commercial banks to get into the\nbrokerage business, they said.\n    \"The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house or\nto go into a business tie-up,\" said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda\nTrust and Banking Co Ltd in New York.\n    One trust bank source said total fees could amount to\naround one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures markets\nfully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets.\n    Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressively\nmany foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammoth\ncapital assets, but the futures brokerage business to be a\ndifferent story, Japanese banking sources said.\n    They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition to\ndifficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers.\n    In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future, some U.S.\nbrokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13\ndlrs per contract, below the break-even level, they said.\n    Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying to\napproach Japanese financial institutions about possible\ntie-ups, a futures indusry source in Chicago said.\n    But Japanese bank sources in New York said the small\ncapital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanese\nnervous about a capital link.\n    Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokerage\nbusiness once financial futures trading by the Japanese starts\ngrowing fast and proves to be profitable, they said.\n    But the big question, they added, is whether the Japanese\ngovernment would let banks engage in this new risky business.\n reuter",

    "title": "EPA TO REJECT CLEAN-AIR PLANS FOR 14 AREAS",
    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) announced plans to disapprove clean-air plans for 14\nmetropolitan areas and called for bans in those areas on new\nconstruction of potentially polluting facilties.\n    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said in a statement the areas\nhad not shown they could meet agency ozone or carbon-monoxide\nair-quality standards by the end of 1987 or soon after.\n    He said the proposed ban on construction would cover such\nindustries as electric utilities, iron and steel production\nplants, industrial boilers and petroleum refineries.\n    The areas affected are Chicago; the Indiana portion of the\nChicago area; East St. Louis, Ill.; the Indiana portion of the\nLouisville, Ky., area; Cleveland, Ohio; Atlanta, Ga.;\nDallas-Ft. Worth, Tex.; Denver, Colo.; the California south\ncoast, including Los Angeles; Fresno, Sacramenta, Ventura and\nKern counties, Calif., and Washoe County (Reno), Nev.\n    Thomas also proposed major changes to existing sources of\npollution in those areas.  They would effective after a final\nassessment of the area's pollution, expected late this year or\nearly next.\n    For Cleveland, the EPA also proposed a restriction on\nfederal highway funding and clean-air grants because the state\nof Ohio did not provide for adequate testing to curb car\npollutions as required by the Clean AirAct.\n    Thomas said:\n    \"It is clear that the state implementation plans for these\nareas will not achieve federal ozone or carbon-monoxide\nstandards under the deadline mandated by Congress. In these\ncircumstances the Clean Air Act leaves no discretion.  I must\npropose sanctions.\"\n    The EPA estimated that another 20 metropolitan areas will\nfail to meet the agency's ozone standards by the end of the\nyear. About 70 are meeting the ozone standards.\n    It added that about 80 areas are now not meeting the EPA\ncarbon-monoxide standards, but only a few will have long-term\nproblems in meeting the standards.\n    The EPA has proposed that car-makers be ordered to install\ncanisters on new cars beginning in 1979 to capture polluting\ngasoline vapors which escape when gas is pumped from filling\nstations to a car's gas tank.\n reuter",

    "content": "Venezuela's cabinet approved a new\nexchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at\n14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,\nMinister Manuel Azpur UA said.\n    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the\nmeasure is \"fundamental to conserving the economic and financial\nstrength of the petroleum industry.\"\n     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the\ncentral bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state\noil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its\nproblem of working capital and implement investment plans,\nestimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when\nthe measure would become effective.\n   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings\nto the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign\nexchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.\n   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic\ngoods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that\nit would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more\ngovernment debt bonds.                        \n    PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at\nthe start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust\nfund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in\ngovernment bonds.\n  According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,\nthe BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by\nrepurchasing the bonds.\n    PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480\nbillion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial\nsales were 8.023 billion dlrs.\n Reuter",

Land\nrights activists see no progress at all and say things are\nactually worsening. Over the last year economic pressures have\nforced many small producers to sell out to big land-owners.\n    Land reform, one of the country's most hotly-debated\npolitical issues, is particularly to the fore this year as a\nConstituent Assembly in Brasilia draws up a new constitution.\n    Land rights campaigners say that if the new charter does\nnot give fresh hope for the country's 4.5 mln landless\nfamilies, there will be wave upon wave of land occupations.\n    \"We make no secret of our tactics,\" said one leader of the\nland reform movement, Joao Pedro. \"The solution is to occupy --\nthat is what we say to the rural workers. There has not been a\nsingle program of land reform in the world without the people\noccupying land.\"\n    The land issue spawns violence from Amazonia to Mato\nGrosso. Some 278 people died in land disputes last year,\naccording to the Pastoral Commission for Land, which is linked\nto the Roman Catholic Church.\n    The land reform program, announced in 1985 soon after the\ncivilian government of President Jose Sarney took power, aimed\nto resettle 1,4 mln families by 1989 by gradually splitting up\nthe country's vast, undeveloped estates.\n    The government, in its National Plan for Agrarian Reform,\ndescribed the program as \"one of its absolute priorities.\"\n    In practice, fewer than 20,000 families have been helped so\nfar and the government admits that it will not get anywhere\nnear the original target.\n    Political analysts said that the pace of land reform was\nnow slower under Sarney than it had been under the military\ngovernment of General Joao Figueiredo (1979-85).\n    The slow progress on the issue is fuelling deep\nfrustration. Land rights demonstrations are a common sight in\nSao Paulo and other parts of the country.\n    Activists say social conditions in the countryside, far\nfrom improving, have significantly deteriorated.\n    Pedro, a leader of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers,\nsaid that over the last 12 months 100,000 small producers had\nbeen forced off the land in Brazil's five southernmost states.\n    He said the exodus had been caused first by the\ngovernment's anti-inflation Cruzado Plan, which last year froze\nprices and hit the income of small farmers.\n    When the Cruzado Plan collapsed late last year, prices and\ninterest rates soared and many small farmers were unable to pay\ndebts taken out during the price freeze.\n    Pedro said most of the 100,000 families who had left the\ncountryside in the south had previously been land-owners, while\na minority had been tenant farmers. Most had moved to Brazil's\nswollen cities.\n    One activist said the number of landless day labourers\ncalled \"boias-frias\" (literally \"cold meals\"), most of whom cut\nsugar cane, had increased to 400,000 in Sao Paulo state from\nabout 300,000 five years ago.\n    In an attempt to improve the lot of the rural poor, the\nland reform movement has drawn up a radical proposal which it\nis sending to the Constituent Assembly.\n    The proposal would severely limit the size of a maximum\npermissible holding and the land rights movement does not\nexpect it to be voted into the constitution.\n    Pedro said at least 70 pct of the 559-member assembly is\ncomposed of big land-owners. He added that the assembly would\nprobably vote on the proposal by October and that its rejection\nwould be the signal for large-scale land invasions.\n Reuter",

    "title": "TEXACO (QTX) MAY BENEFIT FROM SEC BRIEF",
    "content": "The Securities and Exchange\nCommission's entry into the battle between Texaco Inc and\nPennzoil Co <PZL> could affect the outcome of the 10.3 billion\ndlr legal saga, some analysts said.\n    Texaco today said the SEC would file a \"friend of the\ncourt\" brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to the\ncase. Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since\nthey said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the\nrule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas\ncourts.\n    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four\nto 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said the\nSEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its request\nfor a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has been\npreviously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC\nbrief but it did not know whether the brief would support the\nview of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for\nclarification of the reasons for two lower state court\ndecisions.\n    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme\nCourt to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.\n    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a\ntender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an\nalleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.\n    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those\nmaking the offer from entering into contracts for the target\ncompany's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believes\nSEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could\nalso have no affect. \"If this friend of the court brief is\npotent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by the\nTexas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgment\ncould be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing,\" Leuffer said.\n    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal\nbattle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas court\nawarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, later\nreduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award now\ntotals 10.3 billion dlrs.\n    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal\nbankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed to\navoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security\nbond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.\n    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of\nJuly 20.\n    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of other\nanalysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a\nsignificant role. \"The other argument is the court will ignore\nit (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court\nbriefs,\" he said.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not\nexpect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case.\n\"Everyday, you're going to see something like this,\" Cohen\nsaid.\n    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe\nthat the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it\nbelieved the 10b-13 rule was involved. \"I think what the market\nsensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that\nthey may reach for the stars and fall on their face,\" Sales\nsaid. \"They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas,\" said Joel\nFischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and other\nanalysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal\nlaw that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or\nrefuses to hear its case.\n    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to\nthe 10b-13 issue.\n    Sales said the point was argued and the courts\n\"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the\nlegal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope we\ncan correct that misimpression\".\n    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many\npossible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern that\nTexaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded\nby Pennzoil.\n    \"The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae\n(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit\ndisturbed,\" said Cohen.\n    \"What you're seeing is a continual chess game. Every slight\nmove down the road could have a multiplying effect,\" he said.\n Reuter",

These allocations, in turn, have become the basis\nfor contested rate filings the four operating utilities made to\nregulators in their service areas.\n    In a ruling dated June 24 and distributed June 26, the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals in Washington reversed its January 1987\ndecision and ordered FERC to explain its criteria for\ndetermining undue discrimination and why the FERC's allocation\ncurrently in effect is not unduly discriminatory under that\ndefinition, Middle South said.\n    The company said the ruling by the three-judge appeals\ncourt panel \"was totally unexpected, especially in light of the\ntimetable the full 11-member court set in April of this year\nwhen it announced that all judges would rehear the panel's\nJanuary decision in which the panel had upheld FERC.\n    In essence, Middle South said, \"the three-member panel has\nadopted the dissenting opinion as the new majority opinion, and\nthe full court has accepted the new decision.\"\n    The company said it supports FERC's motion for a stay. The\ncommission said it needed the time to determine the appropriate\ncourse it should take in light of the new court decision.\n    \"Given its complexity and the need for clarification by the\nFERC, the significance of this latest order will take time to\ndetermine,\" Middle South said in a statement.\n Reuter",

There appears to be no need to change that policy,\" the\nHUD report said.\n    Any change in Fannie Mae's status would be up to Congress.\n    The HUD report said the options open to Congress ranged\nfrom doing nothing to full and immediate privatization.\n    \"Whatever option is selected, the combination of the\nfavorable economic environment, FNMA's recent move to financial\nhealth, the current strength of the housing market and the\nevolution of FNMA's role in the mortgage market from\ncontributor to competitor would all indicate that the time is\nripe for a positive move toward privatization,\" the report\nconcluded.\n    Fannie Mae operated as a part of the federal government\nfrom the time it was created in 1938 until 1968, when it was\nrechartered by Congress and put under private ownership with\ngovernment backing.\n    However, \"it was always intended that FNMA would eventually\nbecome fully private,\" the HUD report said.\n    Fannie Mae's critics, including some Reagan administration\nofficials espousing a free-market philosophy, say government\nsponsorship of the agency allows it to compete unfairly with\nprivate lenders and investors.\n    But its backers claim mortgage rates would be pushed up as\nhigher agency costs were eventually passed on to home buyers.\n    Fannie Mae was created by Congress to make capital\navailable for housing by buying mortgages from lenders and\npackaging them as securities to sell investors.\n Reuter",

This restrictive policy also gave rise\nto smuggling and hampering of exports.\"\n   \n    He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed\nfrom import restrictions.\n    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from\nremittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the\nGulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the\ndrop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a\nbalance of payments crisis for Pakistan.\n Reuter",

    "content": "A U.S. decision ending a forty-year\ntax treaty covering the Netherlands Antilles was unlikely to\nhave a major impact on the Eurobond market, tax experts said.\n    Most U.S. firms stopped using financial subsidiaries\nincorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell to the\nEurobond market in July, 1984, the experts said.\n    But the decision affects Eurobonds issued before July 1984\ninvolving principal worth an estimated 30 billion dlrs and will\nprobably mean those bonds will be called before their maturity\ndate, they said.\n    Since most of the bonds are currently trading at a premium,\ncalling them in early will mean a loss in market value for the\nbondholders, according to a Treasury official who asked not to\nbe identified.\n    The official said the Treasury Department was currently\nunsure about the impact of the move on the Eurobond market.\n    \"We are monitoring the situation and receiving reports from\ninvestors and issuers,\" the official said.\n    Earlier, the Treasury said it notified the Netherlands of\nthe termination of the treaty effective January 1, 1988.\n    For years, U.S. firms seeking to avoid a 30 pct withholding\ntax used financial subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands\nAntilles to sell Eurobonds, which are bonds issued abroad by an\noverseas financial subsidiary.\n    But most companies have since taken advantage of a 1984\nchange in the law known as the exemption for portfolio interest\nthat allows them to sell directly in the Eurobond market and\navoid the withholding tax.\n    The 1984 tax change sharply reduced the number of U.S.\ncompanies using the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds,\nsaid Steven Hannes of accounting firm Touche Ross and Co.\n    Ending the tax treaty will mean that some foreigners\ninvesting in the U.S. through the Netherlands Antilles will\nlose tax benefits and probably change their portfolios, Hannes\nsaid.\n    He said the decision would mainly affect foreign investors\nwho sought tax advantages because they reside in countries\nwhich do not have a tax treaty with the United States.\n    These investors typically reside in countries in the Middle\nEast, Central and South America, he said.\n    Some of them may withdraw their U.S. investments or seek\ntax relief through the Netherlands itself or Switzerland, but\nthe choices are limited, Hannes said.\n    \"It is conceivable their investment may stay here. They\nwould bear some of the tax that has not been borne in the\npast,\" Hannes said.\n    U.S. domestic bonds are not affected by the change.\n    U.S. companies with Eurobonds issued through the\nNetherlands Antilles are expected to call them early to avoid\nthe tax liability, a Treasury Department spokesman said.

    "content": "Scott Paper Co, one of the leaders in\nthe tissue and coated paper business, said it expects 1987\nearnings to be between 5.75 dlrs and 6.25 dlrs a share, within\nthe range proscribed by most Wall Street analysts.\n    \"We have put together five or six years of pretty\nrespectable growth and three consecutive years of record\nearnings and I see no reason why this growth pattern should be\ninterrupted,\" Scott's chairman and chief executive officer\nPhilip Lippincott told Reuters in an interview.\n    Last year, the company reported earnings of 4.96 dlrs a\nshare, reflecting the impact of a a strike at its Mobile,\nAlabama, plant.\n    Earlier today, Lippincott outlined his bullish growth\nscenario for analysts, emphasizing that the company is dealing\nwith the growing capacity in the industry by developing new\nproducts and modernizing plants. He said that capacity\nincreases in the industry, particularly tissue paper, have\nstymied price hikes but Scott has boosted sales by providing\nmore distinctive products that meet the needs of consumers.\n    \"Scott Paper has shown tremendous growth in the last five\nyears, but I think that improvement is largely unappreciated by\nthe market,\" said analyst Sherman Chao of Salomon Brothers who\nnoted that the stock is selling at a relatively low\nprice/earnings ratio.\n    \"They have been striving for a return on equity of 14 to 17\npct, but today they were talking about a much higher objective.\nThey are raising their financial objectives,\" Chao said.\n    Sales of consumer products increased about four pct last\nyear and showed growth of about five pct pace in the first\nquarter, eclipsing the overall industry wide sales pace of less\nthan two pct, Lippincott said.\n    \"The most favorable thing I came away with today is that\ntheir Sommerset, Maine, plant which makes number four coated\npaper, is sold out through September. That means their coated\npaper business is looking particularly good,\" said Lawrence\nRoss of PaineWebber Group Inc.\n   \n    Analyst George Adler of Smith Barney was equally\noptimistic. \"They don't have anything that is going to set the\nworld on fire right now but I am at a loss to find anything\nnegative either,\" Adler said.\n    He said Scott Paper is continuing to gain market share by\nemphasizing their strategy and developing distinctive products.\n    Lippincott also noted that the company stands to gain from\nthe depressed level of the dollar. \"The bottom line impact of a\nlower dollar was about 15 cts a share in 1986, and we could\nhave a similar impact this year,\" he said.\n Reuter",

However, any delay this year should not\nendanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends\nthrough September, 1988, USDA officials said.\n    \"It will be difficult to pull together the people for the\nmeeting during July,\" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel\nAmstutz said.\n    Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the\nnext talks could still be a \"couple more months,\" he said.\n   \n    There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA\nwill offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next\nmarketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations\nwere held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.\n    \"I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer\nor before the next agreement year begins,\" a USDA source said.\n    Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next\nyear's crops, he said, \"There are too many variables now. It\nwould be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.\"\n    Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a\nminimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and\nU.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of\na new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping\nlogistics and production outlooks.\n Reuter",

But he\nadded that increased competitiveness seems to be behind the\nmove towards greater production in the United States.\n    \"What's peculiar about this group is that it's the most\nsuccessful in terms of profitability, decreasing costs, and\nincreasing quality,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n    Those companies increasing offshore production are at the\nopposite end of the spectrum, he said, not meeting the\nproduction goals they set for themselves.\n    He cautioned that the survey was skewed towards large,\nunusually profitable businesses representing a diversity of\nindustries and regions. The typical respondent was a large\nmanufacturing division with sales of about 200 mln dlrs.\n   \n Reuter",
